Let's go the extra mile\nand reproducibly deploy our home configuration. In this post, I'll show you how to reproducibly deploy a home-manger\nconfiguration without installing home manager.\n\nHere's how you do it: make a shell.nix file:\n\nwith import <nixpkgs> {};\n\nstdenv.mkDerivation rec {\n  name = \"nixops-shell\";\n\n  buildInputs = [\n    nixops\n  ];\n\n  revision = \"06c576b0525da85f2de86b3c13bb796d6a0c20f6\"; # 18.03 on 2018-04-23\n\n  shellHook = ''\n    export NIX_PATH=\"nixpkgs=https:\/\/github.com\/NixOs\/nixpkgs-channels\/archive\/${revision}.tar.gz:.\"\n    export NIXOPS_STATE=\".\/state.nixops\"\n\n    function our_create () {\n      if [ `nixops list | grep -c $1` -eq 0 ]\n      then\n       (set -x; nixops create --deployment $1 \"&lt;$1.nix&gt;\")\n      fi\n    }\n\n    our_create host1 # change this\n    our_create host2 # change this\n  '';\n\n}\n\nThis nix expression for nix-shell installs nixops, pins the version of nixpkgs used by nixops and creates two\ndeployments: \"host1\", and \"host2\". It expects that the host1.nix and host2.nix deployment configuration files already\nexist.\n\nIf the our_create function checks if the deployments exist in the state file, and adds them. If you want to add a new\ndeployment, you add another our_create line in the shell.nix shellHook, exit the nix shell, and restart it.\n\nThe shell.nix file should be commited to version control, and the state.nixops file should be added to the version\ncontrol ignore file (for example, .gitignore).\n\nThere's one more thing you need to do to make this work. By default, nixops stores an SSH key in the state file for\nlogging in as root. We need to add either a shared SSH key, or an SSH key for each collaborator that gives them root\naccess in each host deployment configuration:\n\n{\n  host1 =\n  { config, pkgs, ... }:\n  {\n    deployment.targetHost = \"1.2.3.4\";\n    users.users.root.openssh.authorizedKeys.keyFiles = [ .\/collaborator1.pub .\/collaborator2.pub ];\n  };\n}\n\nAfter the initial configuration, this will allow any of the collaborators to use nixops commands to manage the machine\nusing their ssh key instead of the one provided in the state file.\n\nWith this configuration, we do not rely on any of the information stored in the state file for basic deployment of nixos\nconfigurations to nixos machines.\n" }
,{ "url": "nixops-without-sharing\/", "title": "NixOps Without Sharing", "text": "NixOps Without Sharing2017-10-18\n\nThe default setup for nixops seems to be tuned for a setup involving many machines where the a state file is necessary\nto properly manage the machines. Unfortunately, the state file makes it hard to collaborate because every nixops command\nmodifies the state file.\n\nSuggested fixes include commiting the state file to git and using a shared machine. The former fix breaks if\ncollaborators each run nixops commands in parallel, because they will have a merge conflict on the state file. And the\nlatter approach is tricky, because two people really shouldn't be editing the same repository at the same time.\n\nAnother option, the one that I use, is to configure nixops so the state file is not necessary. Each collaborator will\nhave their own state file, but that's okay, because you won't use it for anything critical. I expect that this will\nbreak some features of nixops, but I haven't run into an issue for my use case of a few machines each with their own\ndeployments, I haven't needed anything aside from nixops deploy, which works.\n\nNote, this will only work if all the machines were provisioned outside of NixOps and therefore do not rely on hosting\nAPIs (like EC2) to manage the machine lifecycle.\n\nHere's how you do it: make a shell.nix file:\n\nwith import <nixpkgs> {};\n\nstdenv.mkDerivation rec {\n  name = \"nixops-shell\";\n\n  buildInputs = [\n    nixops\n  ];\n\n  revision = \"06c576b0525da85f2de86b3c13bb796d6a0c20f6\"; # 18.03 on 2018-04-23\n\n  shellHook = ''\n    export NIX_PATH=\"nixpkgs=https:\/\/github.com\/NixOs\/nixpkgs-channels\/archive\/${revision}.tar.gz:.\"\n    export NIXOPS_STATE=\".\/state.nixops\"\n\n    function our_create () {\n      if [ `nixops list | grep -c $1` -eq 0 ]\n      then\n       (set -x; nixops create --deployment $1 \"&lt;$1.nix&gt;\")\n      fi\n    }\n\n    our_create host1 # change this\n    our_create host2 # change this\n  '';\n\n}\n\nThis nix expression for nix-shell installs nixops, pins the version of nixpkgs used by nixops and creates two\ndeployments: \"host1\", and \"host2\". It expects that the host1.nix and host2.nix deployment configuration files already\nexist.\n\nIf the our_create function checks if the deployments exist in the state file, and adds them. If you want to add a new\ndeployment, you add another our_create line in the shell.nix shellHook, exit the nix shell, and restart it.\n\nThe shell.nix file should be commited to version control, and the state.nixops file should be added to the version\ncontrol ignore file (for example, .gitignore).\n\nThere's one more thing you need to do to make this work. By default, nixops stores an SSH key in the state file for\nlogging in as root.

,{ "url": "add-on-habit-screen-time-equals-exercise-time\/", "title": "Add on Habit: Screen Time Equals Exercise Time", "text": "Add on Habit: Screen Time Equals Exercise Time2015-04-29\n\nScreen time when you are consuming media might not necessarily be a positive habit to add on to, but many of us find\nourselves in front of screens watching videos, TV Shows, Movies, and reading books, news, and blogs. By establishing add\non habit, you can make this relaxing time more productive and fun by adding on some exercises. A lot of people have\ndiscovered the reverse of this. Lots of people read and watch videos at the gym while they are on some exercise machine.\nThis is great and I am not proposing you do something this strenuous. Instead, how about doing some simple stretches,\nleg raises, planks, or squats while using those screens?\n\nI think squats are especially good when you are watching a screen that is far away. You can limit your time sitting and\nat the same time open up your hips and build flexibility in your lower body and lower back. Even a few minutes during\nyour screen time will start to show big gains.\n\nAnother great one I do is leg raises while laying down with my tablet or book. When you are using your arms to stabilize\nthe screen (or book), your legs are basically doing nothing. Get them involved in some hip adductor\/abductor\nstrengthening. One easy one is called \"clams\". You lie on your side with one leg on top of the other with your knees\nbent, and then you slowly separate your knees while keeping your ankles together. The opening is like the mouth of a\nclam. You can do this exercise on both sides. Rotating will help keep your arms from getting tired too. There are a\ncouple of variations on this called \"straight leg raises\". You can also do them on your back if you want to work on your\nhamstring flexibility. I like to sprinkle in these leg exercises randomly as I am using a screen or reading. It keeps me\nactive during an otherwise sedentary period.\n\nI think stretching can be an especially good one to do while using a screen. You can accumulate a good amount of time in\nvarious stretches while watching something without even thinking about it. By hanging out more in some of the end range\nof motion, you can develop more comfort with being in that position. This is how Andrea developed her flexibility to do\nthe splits during high school. Lots of time spent stretching while reading.\n\nScreen watching and reading time can have pretty negative results on your body and overall fitness. By adding a few of\nthese habits into your screen watching time you can augment these activities with positive improvements to your body.\nJust a little motion and activity can go a long way to reversing the negative effects of laying motionless and leave you\nwith more flexibility and strength.\n" }
,{ "url": "motor-control\/", "title": "Motor Control", "text": "Motor Control2015-04-29\n\nWhen you learn how walk, ride a bicycle, or any physical activity, you are learning how to control your muscles in a\nspecific way. This is called motor control. Our bodies have a lot of muscles in them. It is likely that you have not\nlearned to control all of your muscles. There is the coordination between these muscles to learn as well.\n\nI have learned about muscles I can control as recently as a few weeks ago. I learned that you can control the muscles in\nthe arch of your foot while standing. Also, I learned how to individually activate muscles in my quadriceps and back\nmuscles.\n\nWith good motor control, you can smoothly and strongly contract a muscle without engaging the muscles around it. This\ncan be hard at first, because your brain has not necessarily figured out the exact signals to send that create the\nmotion you desire. An example of this is your toes. If you are standing up, you should be able to independently lift up\nyour big toe from your small toes. Alternatively, you should be able to lift up your small toes while keeping your big\ntoe on the floor. These are tricky to do if you have not practiced them before, but with practice, you can develop the\ncontrol to do it. Another example is Spock's Vulcan Salute, which also requires some practice to learn.\n\nAs a newborn, we barely know how to use any of our muscles, but as we get older we begin to learn how to use more and\nmore of them. These obscure muscles and movement patterns above are examples of muscle control that you might not get as\nyou go through life. Learning how to control the muscles in your body and activate them with strength, speed, and\nprecision lets you use your body optimally. You will have more dexterity and strength if your brain has the ability\nrecruit your muscles at the right time.\n\nI often talk about mobility and strength being important, but without motor control, you cannot really have either. If\nyou do not know how to activate a muscle or do a particular pattern, how can you know if you have the flexibility or\nstrength to do it? Motor control is the first step in any plan to improve functioning of an area of your body.\n\nThis is why people do air squats (squats with no weight) before they load up the bar. This is one of the reasons people\nfocus on going smoothly and slowly through a motion. You can only go smoothly and slowly if you have the necessary motor\ncontrol to activate all the fibers in your muscle in the right order. When I started doing calf raises regularly, I\nnoticed that my muscles would twitch at certain points in the motion. I could not go smoothly from flat-footed to toes\npointed. By working on it every day for a minute, I have been able to smooth out the motion greatly. It is not a\nquestion of strength in my muscle fibers it is a question of being able to sequence them correctly to smoothly go\nthrough the motion.\n\nImproving motor control\n\nMotor control improvements start by trying to do a particular motion or activating a particular muscle. Even if you\ncannot make it move, trying helps build up the neurological pathways. When you get motion, focus on repeating it\ncontinuously and making it bigger and more pronounced over time. Another trick that sometimes works is to help hold back\nthe muscles that you do not want to activate. For example, you can hold down your little toes while trying to lift your\nbig toe. Eventually you decrease how much you are holding the muscles back, until you are able to activate the muscle\nindividually without restraining the other ones.\n\nIt is important to have a mindset of persistence when improving motor control. It can take multiple sessions to see\nchanges and improvements. But continually working on it can lead to great gains. This is the principle used to help\npeople that have serious neuromuscular problems, like losing the ability to move a finger, hand, or arm. But the\ntechniques work for healthy people too.\n\nMore motor control is, of course, something you want to have, and you can achieve it without lengthy sessions, but you\nneed to work on it over multiple days to build up your control. The good part is once you have control, it is difficult\nto lose it. It is not like we forget how to ride a bike even after taking a break for a long time. Motor control that\nyou develop now, is likely to keep paying you back for a long time.\n" }
,{ "url": "youtuber-review-mobility-wod\/", "title": "YouTuber Review: MobilityWOD", "text": "YouTuber Review: MobilityWOD2015-04-28\n\nMobilityWOD (Mobility Workout of the Day) is the channel that got me interested in improving my body. There are\nalmost 200 video workouts that you can do to drastically improve your mobility and your motivation to get better. The\nfirst workout is to stay in the bottom of a squat for 5 minutes in a day. When I first started working on this, I could\nnot do more than 20 seconds at a time without a lot of pain. Now I can do a couple of minutes at a time (maybe longer; I\nhave not tried) without a problem.\n\nI think this channel is great at motivating you because Kelly Starrett has a good coach persona. He sounds confident and\negging you on to do better in your workouts. The videos are filmed extemporaneously, which gives them character, but\nsometimes leaves you wondering what you are working on, or why a particular mobility exercise will help you. He uses\nterms like \"internal rotation\", and \"external rotation\", which will seem like jargon to someone who has not studied\nmusculoskeletal mechanics.\n\nI also read the first edition of his book, Becoming a Supple Leopard (link goes to the new 2nd edition), that goes into\nmore detail in a much more organized way. If his videos seem intriguing to you, I recommend getting the book, because it\nmakes the subject a lot more coherent than you get from the short videos. It also has a huge selection of mobility\nexercises in the back of the book, that you can use as a reference to solve your mobility problems.\n\nOverall, I think going through the MobilityWOD playlist is a good way to get excited about improving your body and\nlearning how to do it with explanations that mostly appeal to someone who is not an expert in physical therapy.\n" }
,{ "url": "balance-update\/", "title": "Balance Update", "text": "Balance Update2015-04-27\n\nI added a couple of balancing habits to my day. When I put on my clothes in the morning, I try to do very carefully and\nsmoothly. I try to make sure I am very balanced while doing it. Jumping around, or shifting my weight quickly is\nconsidered a failure, and I need to keep working on it. Also, I have been doing a similar routine when I put on my\nshoes. This is made more challenging by some of my shoes being road cycling shoes, which do not have much traction and\nhave a lot of straps to stick down.\n\nIt has been a couple of weeks since I started focusing on this and trying to make it better. I am happy to report that I\ncan already notice some improvements. Before, I would often need to grab something while putting on my cycling shoes,\nbut now I am shifting my weight quickly only some of the time. At least once, I was able to do it very smoothly.\n\nThis is another achievement toward my goal of increasing my margin of error. I did not need to have smooth balance while\nputting on my shoes and clothes. I could have sat down in a chair to do it. In order to feel like I am living my life\nsafely, I need to feel like I have the strength, flexibility, endurance, etc. above what I need on a normal day. If I do\nnot set my bar higher than a normal day, my body is going to adapt to doing the minimum it can.\n\nIt is very empowering to think that a little focus for a few minutes a day can have an effect in only a couple weeks!\nFocusing on a few projects can lead to real gains in short time. This is true even when minimal time is invested. The\nopposite is also true though. If you do not keep challenging yourself, you will start to see real losses over a short\ntime scale. It is your choice which direction you want to be heading. I do not care how fast or hard you are going but\npick that you will head in the direction of greater strength, flexibility, endurance, and stamina. Choose to get better,\na little at a time.\n" }
,{ "url": "competition-a-good-way-to-get-hurt\/", "title": "Competition: a good way to get hurt", "text": "Competition: a good way to get hurt2015-04-24\n\nLooking back on the physical injuries I have had in my life, I see a recurring pattern. Almost every time I was injured,\nit was because I was competing. I was trying to outdo some other person, showing off, or most often doing competitive\nsports. I do not believe that competition is all bad, and I think that by competing I was able to keep in great physical\nshape as a child, but I think the pattern is alarming.\n\nThe often unchallenged assumption is that people should compromise their body to gain an advantage in sports, weight\nlifting, and other physical activities. I want to challenge it! I think that you should perform below the threshold of\nhurting yourself. I remember playing soccer in high school, I would keep playing even if I slightly hurt my ankle. Now,\nI attribute this to the recklessness of youth and bad coaching. I feel like I would have been much better off if I\ntrained hard enough to increase my skills and body strength to well above the level I expected to need to be at and then\nperform with a nice margin of error\n\nAt the same time I was playing high school soccer, I was also on a park district team. On this team, I was in better\nshape than most of the other players. I was playing two different soccer games. One at the edge of my limits and one\nwith a healthy margin of error. Also, since it seemed comparatively easy, I felt less need to be competitive.\n\nThis sounds like a great way to operate, but I have not figured out how to do it consistently. Whenever I am competing,\nI find myself pushing myself to the edge of my limits. I feel no problem following this advice in my own personal\nexercising though. As long as there is no person I am trying to catch or no record to beat, I am safely able to maintain\nmy margin of error.\n\nCompetition is not the only source of injuries. Sometimes you can randomly be injured by bad luck, or another person\nmight be reckless enough to injure you even when you are safely below your limits. For me though, I feel competition is\nthe most common time I have been injured in the past, and I think it makes sense that you are more likely to be injured\nwhen you are trying to perform at your maximum ability.\n\nLately, I have followed some fairly strict protocol to avoid injury. I avoid team competitive sports, I cautiously and\nnever automatically increase the difficulty of my efforts, I avoid comparing myself to others, and I listen to my body.\nIf I ever feel any pain, I take it very seriously.\n\nThis plan can be a bit lonely because you do not have someone to encourage you or to antagonize you. Your motivation has\nto come from different places. If you are not very competitive, it is probably extreme overkill. But for me, I feel like\nit is an easy rule to follow that leads to a reduction in injuries.\n\nIt is worth it to challenge your assumptions about trying hard. Are you compromising your body for the sake of extra\ngains? Is it really worth it? What if it leads you to a big injury that means you cannot do the activity you love again?\nI try to organize my activities based on avoiding injury. Another strategy is to train harder that you need to. Another\nstrategy might be to practice not caring about the results of competitions. Anyway, avoiding injury should be a chief\nconcern and not one that is superseded by competition.\n" }
,{ "url": "posture-checkpoints\/", "title": "Posture Checkpoints", "text": "Posture Checkpoints2015-04-22\n\nThroughout the day I have developed little cues that cause me to assess and fix my posture. By developing these\ntriggers, I am able to develop a continuous focus on good posture. I think this is a temporary behavior. Once I have\nfully habituated to good posture, I probably will not need to think about it nearly as much. But in the mean time, I\nhave posture checkpoints.\n\nOne major checkpoint for me is sinks. Whenever I am at a sink, I check and reset my posture. Are my feet forward? Are my\ngluteal muscles activated? Is my rib cage in correct alignment with the rest of my body with my shoulders back? I do a\nquick check whenever I am at a sink.\n\nWhen I walk around the office, I try to think about my upper body posture. I try to focus on keeping my shoulders back\nand my scapula flat against my back rib cage. This habit alone probably reversed my rounded shoulder posture that I had\ndeveloped from sitting in front of a computer with bad posture for almost two decades. Slowly over time, my pectoral\nmuscles stretched out and my upper back muscles started to shorten and activate more. It is fun to feel how unobstructed\nyour breathing feels when your upper back muscles are activating nicely. It feels good to be able to contract muscles\nthat I did not even know I had.\n\nAnother checkpoint for me is right before I go to bed. Even though I know I am probably going to move into a bad\nposition when I fall asleep, I try to make sure that I have my body in a nice neutral position before I fall asleep.\nSometimes that means moving a pillow into places to keep my spine and pelvis more neutral while sleeping on my side.\n\nI am also trying to develop a posture checkpoint related to sitting in a chair. I have not yet managed to develop it\nwell, and I still find myself in a state of horrible posture while sitting in a chair or in front of a computer.\nSomehow, this is the hardest bad posture habit for me to break. I think it might be because I can focus so fully on\nprogramming or other tasks that I totally lose focus of what my body is doing, and it defaults to bad old habits.\n\nEven though I have managed to reverse some of the ill effects of bad posture while sitting in front of a computer, I\nhave not managed to stop doing it. I would definitely be open to suggestions for how to periodically assess your posture\nwhile working in front of a computer. One idea I've heard of is to have a device that vibrates at a periodic interval to\nremind you of something. You choose what it reminds you of, so I could choose sitting posture. Another idea would be to\nnot let myself think about anything else unless my posture is good. Basically, make yourself so picky and annoyed by\nyour bad posture that you cannot do anything else until you correct it. I think eventually this could work, but the pain\nand initial productivity loss might not be worth it. One last idea would be to mostly ban sitting from my life. For\nexample, I could try to use my standing desks more frequently and build up my standing endurance. This is something I\nwant to do anyway, but I feel like it is a false solution. I want to be able to have a good posture, even when I am\nforced to sit.\n\nDo you have any checkpoints where you correct your posture? What cues do you have to think about your posture or body\nmechanics? Any ideas how I can fix my posture while engrossed by a computer?\n" }

,{ "url": "fix-yourself-by-searching\/", "title": "Fix Yourself By Searching", "text": "Fix Yourself By Searching2015-04-20\n\nWhen something is not right about our bodies, we should take matters into our own hands. I am a strong believer in self\nhelp being the basis for any self improvement or repair. This is true even when guided by a Physical Therapist. Andrea\ntells me that the patients that take interest in their therapy and do their home exercises are the ones that\nconsistently get better. For most cases, the ones that take a lot longer to get better, or never get better are the ones\nnot paying attention or not doing their home exercises. If I do not care or keep focus on my problems, I will not be\nable to affect changes in my body. If I do not take care, who will?\n\nOne of the critical skills in self care is research. Being able to determine what muscles, tendons, or joints are\nhurting you is an amazing first step in fixing the problems. It does not always work, and for those cases you can\nbenefit from the help of a professional, but you will probably be able to have a more informed conversation if you do\nsome research first.\n\nTo start, I like to search for a particular area followed by the word \"anatomy\". After hiking six miles yesterday, the\nfront of my right lower leg hurts. So I did a picture search for \"front lower leg anatomy\". This yields many\nhigh-quality pictures that help me to narrow down what a muscle or group of muscles that is annoying me is called.\n\nAfter you narrow down which muscles it might be, you can do a video or website search for that name followed by terms\nlike \"mobilization\", \"stretch\", or \"strengthening\" depending on your issue. In my case, searching \"peroneal\nmobilization\" leads to a website of one my favorite YouTubers Athletes Training Athletes which I think would be a great\ntutorial for me to follow in this case. I am amazed by the vast repository of images, websites, and videos awaiting me\nby following a simple chain of research about parts of my body. Often times you can find videos by Physical Therapists\nwho usually tell you exercises that are safe to perform. Of course, with any research, you need to use your best\njudgment and listen to any pain you feel to decide if the exercise is appropriate for you or not.\n\nAndrea will sometimes advise her patients to \"stay off of the internet\". The reason for this is that sometimes patients\nwill read a website that says something like this: \"Pain in your leg could be a sprain, fracture, or cancer.\" Some\npeople assume the worse and get themselves anxious. This is not what I mean by self help! Of course you do not ignore\nall the symptoms. If they combine together to indicate something major, you should see a doctor, but do not\nautomatically assume the worst! Most people probably have a sprained ankle.

I have been in the habit of using fluoride mouthwash ever since I had to\nhave a root canal and, along with flossing, this has paid great dividends of not needing any additional cavities or\nfillings (so far!) after my teeth stabilized. Now I have added toe touching while doing this. Since I use a very mild\nmouthwash, I am able to leave it in my mouth for a couple minutes, so I have plenty of time to do a little stretching. I\ndo a few repetitions of trying to touch my toes.\n\nCurrently, I lack flexibility in my upper back and hamstrings to touch my toes. I do active isolated stretching, with\nslow rhythmic stretches. I start with my arms straight above my head and then slowly move them down to as close to the\nfloor as I can reach. I try to engage my core muscles and move my weight around to stretch different parts of the backs\nof my legs.\n\nGetting some regular stretching time in will be good for counteracting the tight muscles in the backs of my legs from\nsitting and also from cycling. Combined with some mobilization of my muscles, I am hoping to be able to touch my toes\nfor the first time in my life. I feel like toe touching is one of these fitness indicators that is ingrained in my head.\nMaybe it is from one of those Presidential Fitness Tests I had to do in grade school.\n\nFor me, it has been easiest to add on habits during my normal hygiene habits in the morning and night. It feels good to\nbe getting clean and also working on my musculoskeletal system at the same time. If you have not tried it yet, I\nrecommend both mouth washing and toe touching (independently or together), so go off and multitask to better health and\nfitness!\n" }

Depending affinity for the habit\npeople might quickly skip over certain stages. Sometimes we have a bad experience with a habit and we move backwards\nthrough the progression.\n\nI do not know about doing this.\n\nThe first stage and the most common stage for people to be in. This is the stage where they have never heard about doing\nthis activity. Any specific habit is probably not going to be popular or well known to most of the people in the world.\nThis is not really a stage, more of a catchall for everyone not aware of a habit.\n\nNo one can do that.\n\nWhen we hear about people behaving a certain way, it can be unbelievable that they can do and like doing it. For open\nminded people, this can seem like a invalid stage also, but there are a lot of people who refuse to accept different\nways of life and habits in a very exclusionary way. For example, take someone who believes no one can live without the\nInternet or electricity in their house.\n\nWhy would anyone want to do that?\n\nAt this stage, we believe people can do it, but it seems abhorrent to do so. For example, waking up early can seem to be\nso bad that it is hard to believe people actually want to do it. We accept they can do it, but do not understand why\nthey want to. They must be masochists.\n\nI would never want to do that.\n\nNow we understand why people do it, but we do not value what they get out of it. Our values are not in alignment with\ndoing this habit. It does not feel like we will personally gain anything by doing it.\n\nI can not do that.\n\nAt this stage, we see the value in the habit, and see ourselves being happy doing it consistently. But, we do not know\nhow to begin. Our body and mind are not ready to embrace the full consequences of the habit. We have not learned the\nnecessary skills or do not have the necessary equipment to begin.\n\nI tried doing that but it did not stick.\n\nAt this stage you did it a couple of times, but stopped before it stuck. This includes habits restarted every time New\nYear's comes around. A lot of habits might accumulate at this stage. They are the habits you see your best self doing,\nand the habits you once had fully internalized but have since stopped.\n\nI have made it part of my routine.\n\nI figured out how to fit this in to my daily, weekly, or monthly routine. I can keep doing it regularly if I focus on\nit. I need help from add-on habits and maybe other people to keep doing it.\n\nThis is really hard and I have think about it a lot and I do not want to continue.\n\nOnce a habit becomes part of your routine, you start to adapt to it. This can be really hard and make you feel like the\nhabit is a huge burden on yourself. You feel yourself changing and the change does not necessarily feel all good. You\nfeel yourself wanting to resist the change. For example, I decided I would commute to work on a bike last December. At\nfirst this felt all-consuming, like my entire life now revolved around my habit of spending a hour on a bike a day. This\npoint is hard to get past and often makes you want to give up a habit. This is the hardest stage. Once you get over it\nyou are likely to get to the end of the progression.\n\nI am getting used to this.\n\nThe habit is getting easier to do and it takes much less effort and willpower to continue.\n\nI miss doing this.\n\nAt this point, the habit is so part of your routine that you miss doing it. If a day goes by where you cannot do your\nactivity, you feel a small loss. You actively try to arrange your entire life so you can keep up the habit. These are\nthe powerful forces of addiction. They can be forces for good or bad depending on the habit.\n\nWhat habit?\n\nWhen a habit is completely internalized, you think nothing of it. For example, you might think nothing of putting on\nyour shoes before you go outside for a walk. At this stage, the habit is so ingrained that it is hard to separate it\nfrom your identity and sense of self. If someone takes away your habit, you will be indigent. But you do not even notice\nwhen you are doing it.\n\nThis is the habit progression as I see it. Did I miss a stage? What stage are you at on the habits you are trying to add\ninto your life? How can you bump the positive ones up a level?\n" }
,{ "url": "always-have-a-project\/", "title": "Always Have a Project", "text": "Always Have a Project2015-04-14\n\nWanting to keep improving means always having a project that you are working on. In the context of improving my physical\nhealth, I now always have a few projects I am working on. Having these projects helps focus my improvement activities\nand helps keep my positive as I notice myself improving in those areas.\n\nWorking on increasing the mobility of the tissues in my upper left arm is one of my projects. I can feel that when I\nraise my left arm straight up, my shoulder sometimes pops and I feel the left scapular muscles on stretch or sticking.\nIt is quite different from how the same motion consistently feels on the right side. To work on it, I have been\nmobilizing the tissues in the area and trying to think about daily habits that might be contributing to the tightness. I\nhave not been doing as much strengthening as I should. If my triceps were in better shape, I think it would help the\nsituation a lot.\n\nAnother project is my left hip. My left hip joint harbors some pain when I touch the joint capsule. I have been working\non trigger points in my IT band and gluteus medius. Also, I am focusing on activating my gluteus medius to keep my hip\nin better positions. Recently, Andrea helped me loosen up my IT band considerably by attacking some trigger points in\nit, and I noticed I am getting less medial pain in my knee while biking even while increasing intensity.\n\nThe other project I am working on is getting a six-pack. I know what you are thinking, \"how cliché\". But I feel like\nhaving strong core muscles and a lean body is an important general indicator of health and seeing my muscles starting to\ngrow out of nowhere when I look in the mirror is a great feeling. Spousal compliments in this area also reinforce and\nencourage. For this, I am trying to do planks somewhat regularly and I am bicycling to work almost every day for\nroughly 50 miles of cycling a week. By making sure to engage my core muscles while cycling, I think it is slowly helping\nbuild these muscles.\n\nThese are just my current top-of-my-mind projects on body health. If one of them starts to get completed or stops\nimproving quickly, I might switch over to another goal, or seek outside help to help improve. I think it is important to\nhave some focus. Having just a few goals to work on lets you assess your situation and progress better. It also lets you\npay attention to the small factors that might be affecting these particular projects.\n\nAnother reason to have projects is that if you do not, what will you work on? Being aimless in your health or other life\ngoals is a sure way to look back and feel like you wasted your time. They say when people retire if they have a hobby or\nfriends to hang out with they will live for a lot longer. I think this same concept applies in a less extreme way to all\nof the various aspects of your life. If you do not have a project in that area of your life, that area is probably\nslowly dying.\n\nMaybe a project you focus on does not work out, but at least you worked on it. I feel much better knowing I put effort\ninto trying to improve, than I do from looking back at places in my life where I did not try. More often, you will find\nthe focus will cause you to improve significantly in the areas you are focusing on.\n\nWhat projects are you working on? Do you have a set of projects in different areas of your life? These projects are my\nprojects in the area of musculoskeletal health. I have other projects in other areas of my life. What areas are you\ntrying to constantly improve in?\n" }
,{ "url": "posture-power-butt-squeezed\/", "title": "Posture Power Butt Squeezed", "text": "Posture Power Butt Squeezed2015-04-13\n\nThe next critical posture point is the hips. First, do not forget to keep your feet forward The easiest way to get your\nhips in proper alignment is to squeeze your butt. When you flex your gluteal muscles the hips get pulled into proper\nalignment with respect to your legs and lower back.\n\nHaving good hip posture can help with lower back and lower extremity issues. The proper hip rotation can give your lower\nback the right curvature and move your knees into a better position that supports your weight.\n\nWhen I use my standing desk, I notice that when I flex my gluteal muscles, there is less stress on my knees and the\nsurrounding tissues. This might seem surprising, but our bodies are a chain of muscles and bones that all connect\ntogether. I love the feeling of locking into a good posture. I feel like all my muscles are flexing just right and\nsupporting my weight and taking the load of my joint tissues.\n\nMaking a habit of squeezing your butt at some regular times of the day will help improve your tone and the endurance of\nthe muscle group, so it will be more likely to work while you are going about your day. Unfortunately, modern life with\nlots of sitting has made these muscles flabby. While you are sitting it is hard to activate your gluteal muscles. The\nmore you sit, the more they atrophy and your ability to activate the muscles diminishes.\n\nLuckily you can reverse the trend and send recruit these muscles to aid you in attaining posture power. The goal is to\nform the habit where you assess and work on your posture regularly throughout the day. At first, this will seem almost\nhopeless, but if you keep it up, you will start noticing that you automatically assume the correct posture as you go\nabout your day.\n" }

,{ "url": "how-i-cured-my-chronic-ankle-pain\/", "title": "How I Cured My Chronic Ankle Pain", "text": "How I Cured My Chronic Ankle Pain2015-04-08\n\nActually, it was not me. Andrea gets all the credit for this one!\n\nMy chronic ankle pain started four years ago when I was playing soccer with my co-workers, and I got an ankle sprain\nthat I did not think was that bad. I was barely feeling the acute pain after only a couple of days: a happily swift\nrecovery.\n\nUnfortunately, I began to notice that I had a twinge of pain in my ankle when I walked on it. It would be particularly\nbad after getting up from a chair and it would come and go. It never annoyed me enough to seek help but I asked Andrea\n(my girlfriend and student of physical therapy at the time) to look at it. She performed all the ankle tests she knew\nand none of them produced any obvious results. It seemed like my ankle was strong and healthy. The question was, why was\nthe pain still there though? It would bother me occasionally and at some point I was resigned to having these ankle\npains for the rest of my life.\n\nLuckily for me though, a physical therapy student eventually becomes an experienced physical therapist. Experienced\nphysical therapists know that the body is a complex system with the parts of the body connected in a chain. Also, pain\nfelt in one place might be caused by a problem in another.\n\nOne night, I said \"I wonder if I will have this ankle pain forever.\" Andrea said, \"You know, I wonder if it is actually\nyour hip.\" She did a couple of tests and suggested some hip strengthening exercises that I could do that might help.\n\nIt amazes me that since that night, I basically have had no episodes of this chronic pain that had been slightly\nannoying me for almost three years. That is some precision knowledge deployment there! As long as I keep my hip strong,\nI probably will never have to feel that pain again.\n\nI think a lot of people might be able to benefit from similar experiences. Do not stay quiet about your chronic pains,\neven if they are small. Research them, try doing light strengthening exercises to help alleviate the issue. If it does\nnot get better, seek the advice of your doctor or physical therapist. The longer you wait to treat a chronic malady the\nharder it will be to remediate.\n" }
,{ "url": "why-slouching-is-bad\/", "title": "Why Slouching Is Bad", "text": "Why Slouching Is Bad2015-04-07\n\nWhen I was little I got some cues from adults that slouching is bad and that I should try to maintain good posture.\nUntil recently, I never really took their advice to heart. I do not recall anyone explaining to me why I should not\nslouch and at some point, no one reminded me about slouching anymore during class or at home in front of the computer. I\nwill try make a case for why it is bad.\n\nEven though I have internalized this case, I still have not conquered my slouching habits. When I am focusing and using\na computer, my posture suffers greatly. But, by being mindful of my posture, I think I am steadily increasing the\npercentage of time that I am not in a terrible position.\n\nI see you shifting in your chair as you read this. Get comfy and balanced as we build our case against slouching.\n\nWhen you slouch you support your body through your spine and the discs in your spine. It is like you are hanging your\nbody off of your spine. With good posture, your body weight is supported through your muscles that wrap around your\nbody. Your muscles are much better at taking load and abuse of the weight of your body than your vertebra and discs.\nYour muscles heal more quickly and respond to stresses by getting stronger. Your bones and discs are not good at\nresponding to stresses and eventually can be worn down from repeated stresses. When slouching, people tend to have the\nhead far out of alignment from where it would be in a neutral postural position. The more out of alignment it is the\nmore force your body (probably your spine if you are slouching) needs to generate to keep you from falling over.\n\nI think that the sudden rib pain I was feeling in my left ribcage was because I was crushing the little muscles that are\nbetween the ribs. Since I started slouching less and building up the muscles that support this region, I have not had\nany shooting or sudden pain in my ribs.\n\nSlouching also reduces the size of your lung cavity. Some of the muscles that are responsible for posture are also\nresponsible for breathing. If you maintain a good posture, these muscles will be stronger and more capable in helping\nyou breathe. If you slouch for most of the day, you might even find these postural breathing muscles have atrophied to\nthe point where they can barely be activated. The muscles that move when you breathe while slouching will have to work\nharder. You also probably will not get the full range of motion of your diaphragm. You will not be getting good \"deep\"\nbreaths that fill your lungs.\n\nLastly, by slouching or resting your body on the back of a chair, you are depriving yourself of balancing practice. When\nyou use your postural muscles, they have to maintain your balance so you do not move or fall. This might not seem like\nmuch, but having good balance and proprioception is important for all the movements you make with your body. Good sense\nof body position will make you more likely to assume a good position while performing an activity that you have not\ndeveloped your skill at. Overall, the better your balance and postural muscles are the less likely you will put yourself\ninto a compromising position and get yourself hurt.\n\nWell there it is, the case for why we should not slouch. It is a noble goal, but also a hard to achieve one. Be mindful\nof your position and you will improve your posture over time. Choose to go down the path toward improved posture one\nstep at a time. We have years of bad habits to break down, but thankfully we all have plenty of time to do it!\n" }
,{ "url": "cultivating-your-time\/", "title": "Cultivating Your Time", "text": "Cultivating Your Time2015-04-06\n\nI used to spend a lot of my time playing video games. I played for many hours on the weekends and on some week nights\nafter work. It felt fun and fulfilling in the moment, but the aftertaste was not good. I felt like I was wasting the\nlittle time I have to live; that I was not living well. I tried giving it up a number of times, but I kept falling into\nmy habit of gaming for hours.\n\nI like to think of our time as a field has various crops being cultivated in it: families, jobs, hobbies, cooking,\nleisure, etc. By continuing to live we invariably live in some way that uses our time. You can look at your field of\ntime and see what is using it up. Maybe your job and commute is a big orchard in the middle of the field; maybe you have\ncarved out a small garden where you tend to your favorite hobby. Whatever you spend time on is what is growing in your\nfield. Some of the cultivars are carefully planted and produce a sweet fruits. Some are weeds, filling in the land by\ndefault. Some of the land is mortgaged and you must grow cash crops on some of the land to pay back the debt.\n\nHow you think about what is growing in your field is different from how I feel about what is growing in mine. I feel\nlike activities like playing games and reading news are weeds. They grow to fill in all the space not being used by the\nmore structured farming. The trouble with weeds is if you remove them all from your field, you leave behind empty space\nthat has to be filled in with something. The field of your life cannot be empty, because you are always living. So what\ngrows in place of the weeds you banned from your field? More weeds.\n\nReducing video game playing and news reading does not work for me. If I ban video games, I find myself doing some other\nactivity that does not seem valuable either. Instead, I have found what works is to carefully cultivate habits that\ncrowd out these weeds. Perhaps making health and exercise my ground cover, writing these posts a few rows of trees, and\ncalling my parents and sister regularly a soothing grove.\n\nIt is like a game to keep the field growing what you want it to be growing such that it crowds out all the wasted time,\nthe weeds in your field. One cool part about this for me is it satisfies some the same desires satisfied by playing\nvideo games: how can I optimize and plan my habits so that I feel like I am building a lovely field that I will be proud\nto have created? This is the question I am answering and I hope you will too for yourself.\n" }
,{ "url": "what-is-a-trigger-point\/", "title": "What is a Trigger Point?", "text": "What is a Trigger Point?2015-04-03\n\nA Trigger Point is a spot in your muscle that has gotten irritated and forms a tight balled up part of the muscle.\nTrigger points are painful to touch or at least when moderate pressure is applied. When your muscles have bad trigger\npoint or lots of trigger points in them, they can become tight overall and pull on the tissues and joints they are\nconnected to.\n\nTrigger points can often be treated so they go away completely and changes in body mechanics, stretching, and massage\ncan keep them from coming back.\n\nThere are a bunch of common places where trigger points form. The first place I learned about is the calf muscles. My\ncalf muscles were very tight and had a few different trigger points in them. Andrea taught me that if I press on the\ntrigger points and massage them they will hurt, but afterward they will feel more relaxed. Sometimes you have to push\nhard enough that the muscle becomes inflamed for a few days in order to make a change in the tissue, but I recommend\nstarting with light pressure and seeing it that helps.\n\nAnother common place to have a trigger point is in your upper trapezius. You will commonly see people massaging the area\nwhere the trapezius meets the upper shoulder. If you have a desk job and your upper body posture is not good, you will\nprobably have an insanely tight upper trapezius with plenty of trigger points in it.\n\nSince you should not be harboring pain, trigger points should be addressed. Ideally, all of your muscles will not have\nany painful regions in them when you massage them. It is amazing to feel how different your calf muscle can feel if you\ngo from having lots of tightness to having a supple and smooth muscle. It can almost turn into an obsession to clean out\nall of the trigger points that are in your muscles.\n\nBe careful and go easy at first. If you go too hard. you can bruise your muscles or cause a nasty inflammation that\nmakes the muscles tense up even more. After you have worked on an area, give it a chance to rest and recover before\ngoing at it again. Also, keep in mind that maintaining your muscles can take less time than waiting for trigger points\nto build up and get worse before working on them.\n" }
,{ "url": "listening-to-pain\/", "title": "Listening to Pain", "text": "Listening to Pain2015-04-01\n\nIn addition to recognizing your body should not be harboring pain, you should listen intently and react quickly to the\npain you feel. Throw out the phrase \"no pain no gain\", and the idea of \"powering through\" a workout or exercise. You\nonly get one body; do not screw it up with short-term thinking! If you knew could only have one car for the rest of your\nlife, would you be a more careful driver? I am surprised when I see people beating on their bodies when they are clearly\nfeeling pain.\n\nI am not saying you should never feel any pain, just that if you continue to have pain doing an activity, you need to\nchange the way you are going about it. For all but a professional athlete, this should be easy advice to follow. Look at\nwhat you are doing and what hurts and try to figure out what is going on. Take it easy. Slowly build up your workload.\nWork complimentary muscles to help support problematic areas. Look for problems in your form, posture, and technique.\nBut, for the sake of your one and only body that you were given in this life, do not keep doing what you are doing!\n\nRecently, I have been biking to work almost every day. It is a 6.5 mile bike ride each way. I noticed that my knees were\nstarting to hurt. I took many corrective actions. First, I immediately decreased my cycling intensity so the pain\nsubsided. Second, I mobilized the tissues surrounding the knee joint and continued to strengthen my hip muscles. Third,\nI researched bike posture and fitting to see if I had a problem. I found that bike seat was too low and this was putting\nadditional pressure on my knees because I was not going through a complete-enough range of motion in my knee. Increasing\nmy saddle height has reduced my knee pain significantly, and I have been able to pedal harder than before too!\n\nIf you keep riding into your pains and aches without regard for them, you will find yourself at a surgeons office. After\nsurgery, you will probably never be able to reach your peak functioning again. Preventing injuries before they become\nserious requires building up the habit of listening to your body. You never know when a slight twinge can develop into a\ntrigger point or muscle tear. You do not need to be paranoid but at the same time do not be blind when an injury is\nbrewing in your body.\n" }
,{ "url": "muscle-bundles\/", "title": "Muscle Bundles", "text": "Muscle Bundles2015-03-31\n\nWhen I first started learning about muscles in school, I learned the major names for muscles: Quadriceps, Biceps,\nHamstrings, Calves, Abs, Pecs. These names are a simplification because they make it seem like there is only one muscle\nin these places, when actually these are names for groups of muscles. The muscles in our bodies form a complex\noverlapping, neighboring, and layered system of muscles. Do an image search for \"quadriceps cross section\", to see what\nI mean. There is an amazing array of muscles and tendons that are next to one another in the same area.\n\nHaving all of these tissues packed next to each other has interesting consequences: strong tissues can compensate for\nweak ones, tissues can adhere to one another forming what are called adhesions, they can rub or snap against each other,\nand, through tightness, they can limit the range of motion of one another. This creates a complex system of\ninterrelations between different muscles. If one of your leg muscles gets stuck to another, it can start to atrophy as\nit no longer is supporting a load. This can further be compensated for by another nearby muscle taking over the job.\nEventually, you lose (or never gain in the first place) the ability to activate a particular muscle with your brain,\nwhich is called poor motor control.\n\nThis problems can also be reversed. Adhesions can be broken up, you can build your muscle control for a particular\nmuscle, you can stretch your muscles so they do not limit each other, and you can develop a training routine that makes\nsure your muscles get the individual attention they deserve.\n\nOnce I started to understand these concepts and work through these problems and interesting thing happened. I started\nrealizing there were muscles that I did not know I had. An example of this was my serratus anterior muscles. I started\nbeing able to activate or flex muscles in my body in ways I had never done before. This is especially empowering and\ninteresting. When you see a new muscle sticking out from the bundle of muscles it becomes easier to understand how to\ntrain that muscle and how to treat the problems with it. I am not saying you need to look like a body builder, but as\nyou go a little bit toward that, you will start to notice some muscles you see in those pictures.\n\nGoing down the path of improving your own body's bundles of muscles requires understanding this concept of the complex\nsystems of your muscles. The more you learn about this subject, the more you can address problems, and improve your\nbody's muscular system.\n" }

If they are pointed forward and equally spaced,\ncongratulations, you have good foot posture. Unfortunately, most people do not have good foot posture because they got\ninto the habit of not exercising their full ankle range of motion, and, over time, lost that full range of motion. To\nmake up for that range of motion, your feet either bow in or outward. It is more common for them to bow outward. If you\nmove your feet so your toes are forward, you might notice a slight discomfort in your ankles. If you get into the habit\nof keeping your toes pointed forward when standing, you will be able to rebuild your ankle range of motion and this\ndiscomfort will go away and you can reap the benefits of having a powerful posture.\n\nAt first, this will feel like a chore because you have to constantly correct yourself, but you will eventually find\nyourself doing it totally automatically without noticing.

Your body can do it totally on\nautopilot.\n\nHere are some places you can watch your posture:\n\n  - At a sink\n  - In the shower\n  - In front of the refrigerator\n  - In a checkout or order line\n  - At a urinal (if you use those)\n\nI think correcting yourself in a few places consistently will fix your foot posture in all places. Having your toes\nforward will become the new normal.\n\nHaving your toes pointed forward as your default foot posture is very helpful for your overall posture. It keeps your\nhips nicely aligned with your pelvis, and it reduces the force caving in (pronating) or bowing out (supinating) the\nbottoms of your feet. Also, having a good ankle range of motion will keep your ankle muscles strong and make it easier\nfor you to walk with good form. Lots of benefits accrue from a small change consistently applied to your body.\n\nOverall, proper posture is very important for making sure your body has the lowest chance of injury and that you can\ngenerate the most force or strength your body is capable of. Make the change today and start feeling yourself on your\nway to unlocking your posture power!\n" }

Usually at a\nmeeting you need to talk and listen, but what you do with your hands usually does not matter (except maybe if you need\nto take notes). Reclaim this down time by adding on the habit of doing soft tissue mobilization while having a meeting\nof the minds with your coworkers.\n\nMy favorite somewhat-discrete mobilization to do at a meeting is to work on my calf muscles. I cross my legs, which puts\nmy calf muscle nicely in reach of my hands. Then, I massage the knots and tight spots of the tissue during the meeting.\n\nIf you regularly have meetings, this can be a great way to remember to do some mobilization. Since there are parts of\nyour body that are regularly getting tighter and stiffer, it is great to be able to regularly address these issues with\nan add-on habit.\n\nAnother mobilization target that you can do during a meeting is your upper Trapezius. You can jab your fingers into this\nmuscle and do a functional release by moving your shoulder around looking for tight parts of the tissues. The upper\nTrapezius is another muscle that really commonly gets tight for people. This is the muscle tightness that makes a upper\nback massage feel so good when it releases the tightness.\n\nHere is a quick list of body improvement techniques to try while sitting in a meeting:\n\n  - Calf mobilization\n  - Ankle rotations\n  - Upper Trapezius\n  - Shoulder rolls\n  - Neck stretches\n  - Tricep mobilization\n  - Rotator cuff mobilization\n  - Rectus Abdominius mobilization\n" }

This was probably from sitting in front of a computer for almost all of my waking hours. Back pain is one of\npervasive job hazards of being a computer programmer or office worker. This pain seemed more serious to me than the\nother joint aches I had in my body and try to seek a way to correct it. I came upon a very easy exercise routine that\nhelped me to not feel back pain for many years now.\n\nI did plank (or planche) exercises every morning. Sounds like I a lot of work, right? In reality, it takes only about\none minute a day. Pick a good time of day to add on your planks. Maybe right when you wake up, or right before you put\non your work clothing. You can do it anywhere there is some open floor. I used to like to do mine on a yoga\/exercise\nmat, but carpet works fine.\n\nTo do a simple plank, put your elbows and forearms down on the ground with your upper arm and elbow making a 90 degree\nangle with the forearms. Shoulders should be directly above the upper arm and in a neutral position. Flex your abdominal\ncore muscles and squeeze your butt tightly. Your legs should be out back with your feet spaced at about shoulder width\napart. Look straight down at the floor with your head and neck in a neutral position. The only points of contact with\nthe floor are your forearms and toes. This should force you into a good position, but let me describe what a good\nposition is anyway. A good position will have your butt slightly above your knees and your back will not be arched or\ncaved in.\n\nHold this position for as long as you can at first. I eventually got up to two repetitions for one minute each. I\nbelieve for a lot of people this can be all it takes to go from feeling a slight regular pain to being pain free in your\nback. If you find that you need to lift heavy objects occasionally, this will probably not be enough exercise to keep\nyour core in good shape and your spine well-protected. For this, you should look into doing more plank repetitions,\nprogressively harder variations and other core strengthening exercises like stomach vacuuming and weight lifting. Sports\nlike running and cycling are also good at building core strength if you work on having good form.\n\nA little maintenance exercise can go a long way at addressing chronic aches and pains you have in your body. The same\ntechnique can apply to a variety of other pains you might be feeling.\n" }
,{ "url": "add-on-habit-balancing-while-dressing\/", "title": "Add-on Habit Balancing while Dressing", "text": "Add-on Habit Balancing while Dressing2015-03-23\n\nThis is an easy add-on habit that serves as a diagnostic tool and an improvement exercise. When you are putting your\nshorts, pants, or underwear, try to move your legs in a very methodical way where you are in complete control of the\nposition at all times. If you can, do this without holding on to any object to help steady yourself. Try to maintain\nperfect balance while dressing and undressing yourself.\n\nIf this is difficult for you, steady yourself on an object and over-time reduce the amount of force you are placing on\nthe object. With continued effort, you will eventually improve your balance enough to avoid needing an object. You might\nnotice that you still are moving your body in an uncontrolled manner to steady yourself. Focus on a very smooth, slow,\nand controlled motion while dressing.\n\nOnce you can do this in a very smooth and controlled way, you can speed up to challenge yourself. Another modification\nyou can do to challenge yourself is to go up on the ball of your foot that is resting on the ground. Or, if you are\nreally extreme, balance on the heel of your foot.\n\nAnother place to apply this balance exercise is putting on your shoes, so once you feel pretty comfortable with your\nbalance, try putting on your shoes while standing up. The goal is to be able to put on your shoes in a slow controlled\nmotion with only one foot on the ground at a time.\n\nWhen I started add on this habit, I noticed that I could balance while putting on my clothes, but it was always with big\nswings of my arms and legs. Over time, I have increased my balance margin of error. Sometimes, when I dress quickly I\nlose focus and revert back to my old ways. It is okay when this happens: refocus yourself and continue to improve your\nbalance!\n" }

The part people often focus on are their\nRectus Abdominis muscles, also known as, \"The Six Pack\". While this muscle serves as a popular indicator of a person who\nis in shape, the other muscles in your abdominal region are arguably more important to overall core strength, spinal\nprotection, and postural position.\n\nI would like to focus on the Transverse Abdominis. The Transverse Abdominis are the most internal or deep abdominal\nmuscle. They wrap around your whole front and stabilize the trunk when it contracts. They are also used during breathing\nwhere they help change the shape of the cavity your lungs are in.\n\nAn easy way to activate the Transverse Abdominis is to \"suck in\" your gut. This is also sometimes called \"stomach\nvacuuming\". Well developed, and strong Transverse Abdominis muscles will allow you to move your gut in so that it is\nmore internal that your rib cage, and you will see the outline of your rib cage if you look at yourself in a mirror\nwhile doing the exercise. By holding your stomach inward, you are contracting and working the Transverse Abdominis. You\ncan also work it by slowly and purposefully moving from all the way sucked in to all the way bulged out. When you bulge\nout your abdominal region, you are working other muscles more, but your Transverse Abdominis moves along with and will\nbe stretched through its range of motion.\n\nI add this stomach vacuuming exercise onto my habit of flossing my teeth twice a day. While I am flossing, I either keep\nmy Transverse Abdominis contracted, or I move it in and out. You can add this on to any time where you are standing up.\nFor example, you might do it in the checkout line at the store, or while you are washing your hair in the shower. There\nare really a lot of places you can add a few Transverse Abdominis workouts.\n\nThe benefits of working this muscle group is that, as it tones, your stomach will be much more flat because it will pull\nyour stomach inward. It will also help you breathe more effectively and help you protect your spine from injury. When\nyou make this muscle stronger, the harder-to-exercise complimentary muscles in your back will also get stronger because\nthey will need to keep up with your stronger Transverse Abdominis.\n\nI strongly recommend giving this a try, because when I started doing it, I noticed immediately that my stomach looked\nbetter and healthier. You do not need to be all the way to having a six-pack to be producing a much stronger and nicer\nlooking group of core muscles.\n" }

When you move through your\nnormal, full range of motion, you should not feel pain. When sit motionless you should not feel pain. Unless you\nactually have a neuro-muscular disorder where that causes you to constantly feel pain, you should not feel pain.\n\nTwo years ago, I did not believe this. I had chronic pain in my ankle, hip, and shoulder. A spasm of the muscles in\nbetween my ribs would leave me feeling like I could not breath for a few seconds at a time about once a week. I told my\ndoctor that I thought the sudden rib pain could potentially be something related to a heart attack. My grandpas all died\nan early death from a heart attack. My doctor quickly ruled that out though and said \"You are having some\nmusculoskeletal pain. Do not worry about it\". My doctor did not believe what I wrote in the paragraph above.\n\nThere are too many people out there living with small aches and pains. They most often attribute the pain to getting\nold. Or, to some injury that they have decided will not heal. I was the same way. I thought I would permanently have\nthis ankle pain from a then-two-year-old soccer injury. I thought my sudden rib pain was a condition I would have to\ncome to accept.\n\nI was so wrong. Over the last year, I have all but eliminated these chronic pains from my body. Through principals of\nPhysical Therapy, anatomical awareness, body awareness, self-mobilization, and body weight exercises, I have corrected\nmany problems with my musculoskeletal system, driving out the pain that was harbored in that part of my body.\n\nYou can work to rid your body of these aches and pains, but you have to believe that your body is not meant to harbor\npain. That pressing on your tissues and joints should not cause you to feel the slightest discomfort. If you cannot\nbring yourself around to believing this, you will not have the motivation to correct the problems in your body. You will\nforever be resigned to being the person who has chronic aches and pains. You can go about living the rest of your life\nin pain, or you can choose to change your beliefs and believe that you can personally correct the problems in your body.\nBelieve that you are in control of your body!\n" }

Instead\nof bending your elbow while you lift your shoulder to put on deodorant, you keep your palm pointed forward (maybe toward\na mirror) and your arm completely straight. In this position, your arm will be parallel to and in-line with your body.\nThe goal is to regain and maintain full range of motion so that your arm can be pointing directly upward without\nrotating your rib cage or recruiting any of the muscles in your torso or neck. Do each arm while applying deodorant to\nit. Yay for multitasking!\n\nWhen your first start doing this, you may find that you do not have full range of motion. Or, that your shoulder capsule\nis hurting, or your triceps are tight, or your rotator cuff muscles are restricting the motion. That is okay. The more\ntime you spend at your maximum range of motion, the more likely you will be able to increase the range to the maximum.\nMassage your shoulder and triceps before and after this motion if you have time.\n\nI started doing this add-on habit because I realized that my left shoulder capsule had pain before I could reach full\nrange of motion. Since you generally should not have pain when you move your body around or press on it, I knew I needed\nto work on it. I have been doing this practically every day for a year now, and I can report that my pain at end range\nhas drastically gone down. I still have some tightness in my triceps at left shoulder end range, so I will keep working\non it. I plan to keep up this habit for the rest of my life because it is so easy to add, does not take extra time, and\nwill keep my shoulders in good shape.\n" }
,{ "url": "increase-your-margin-of-error\/", "title": "Increase Your Margin of Error", "text": "Increase Your Margin of Error2015-03-16\n\nYour body is an adaptive system. No two bodies are the same because they have all adapted to different stresses placed\non them. Cyclists develop big quads, and rowers develop the shoulders and arms. Your body is strengthening in response\nto stress and atrophying from disuse.\n\nThe upside to this is that if you can keep the various parts of your body mildly stressed you can keep your body in a\nstate of global improvement, where all parts are getting better simultaneously.\n\nThe downside is, if you are like me, probably do not have much of what engineers call a margin of error. The margin of\nerror of your body is how far you have to challenge it beyond your normal routine before some part of the system fails.\nYour body is always adapting to your environment, and it works to minimize the energy expended. This was great for your\nancestors who could eat fewer calories because the muscles they did not need were not getting big. But not so great for\nmodern you living in a calorie-rich environment.\n\nThis adaptation means your body becomes just barely good enough to handle the maximum stresses placed on it throughout\nyour routine. On my path to increasing my overall physical fitness, I had a few moments when I realized some routine\ntask in my life was a lot easier than it used to be.\n\nMy wife and I do not sleep in a bed. We sleep on a mattress on the floor. When we get up, we go from squat to stand. I\nnever thought about this motion being difficult for me, but once I had developed my squatting strength, I noticed I\ncould much more easily get out of bed. On the flip side, before I started working on my squatting muscles, I was on the\nverge of not being able to get out of bed!\n\nI have noticed similar situations when balancing on one leg to put on my shorts, easing myself down onto a toilet seat,\nand picking up my wife while hugging her (she wants me to say it is all due to her weight going down).\n\nAll these routine actions had such a low margin of error, that I was always living on the edge of making one stressful\nmove that would lead me to fall or hurt my back. You may think you are far away from the old lady you see using a\nwalker, but I am afraid that most of our margins of error are so small that we are not far away from that at all.\n\nLet us build our margin of error in our daily activities. By putting short but intense stresses on all of the parts of\nmy body, I believe I will continue to build my margin of error. Constantly listen to your body and look for where your\nmargin of error has gotten too thin. You will know when it happens, it is called pain.\n" }

There is a gap between how people wished they\nbehaved and how the do. There are plenty of people who have advice for what you should be doing with your time, but few\nexplain how you can actually transform your habits to implement their prescriptions.\n\nA year ago, I wanted to do a better job of caring for my body. My main driving goal was to eliminate pain that I felt\nevery day: my lower back hurt, sometimes I would have sudden rib pains that made it difficult to breathe for five\nseconds, my left hip and ankle are painful on occasion. One major motivator was Kelly Starrett's mobility workout of the\nday video blog series. Watching these videos made me realize that, with hard work, I could figure out what is wrong with\nmy body and fix it.\n\nWatching videos will not make you better on its own. You have to develop habits where you continually work on improving\nyour physical condition. Maybe this sounds great to you; maybe you've watched a few of Starrett's videos. How do we go\nfrom our desire to have a habit to actually having one?\n\nI've stumbled on a way to reasonably decent plan for how anyone can develop a new positive habit. The idea is that you\ntake a positive habit from your life that you already have and add your new habit on to that one. I call it an \"add-on\nhabit\" or \"adding on a habit\". What does it mean to \"add on\" a habit? It means you use your ingrained habit as a cue or\nstimulus for your new desired habit. For example, you might do the habit you want to install right after or even during\na currently in place positive habit.\n\nOne positive habit I have that my parents ingrained in me (Thanks Mom and Dad), is brushing my teeth. Every morning and\nnight I brush my teeth. I've done it so long now that it is completely automatic. There is no resistance in my mind\nabout brushing my teeth. It's almost completely guaranteed that I will do it. You might have a similar habit; you might\nhave the habit of brushing your teeth.\n\nWhat I did last year is add air squatting on to brushing my teeth. You can try this yourself, watch Starrett's original\nsquat video for how to do the squat. Then do it while brushing your teeth. If you do it in the morning and night, you\nwill have accumulated about 4 minutes a day of squatting without much effort. The best part about this is you don't have\nto out-of-nowhere remember to do squats, you know that you always do squats when you brush your teeth.\n\nI am surprised by how effective this technique is for developing new positive habits. One possible trap to avoid is you\ndo not want to add a positive habit onto a negative one. For example, don't do air squats while eating unhealthy food.\nIf you manage to kick the bad habit later, you will have also kicked the positive add-on habit.\n\nTry this with other habits and let me know what habits you are able to create. I will be sharing additional add-on\nhabits that I have developed over the course of this past year in future posts.\n" }

,{ "url": "how-to-survive-angels-landing\/", "title": "How to survive Angel's Landing", "text": "How to survive Angel's Landing2012-06-30\n\nI recently hiked Angel’s Landing at Zion National Park with my girlfriend. We are both 26 and in fairly good shape. The\nhike to Scout Lookout is strenuous, uphill for 2 miles. The last 0.5 miles up to Angel’s Landing is technical and\ndangerous. The sign says 6 people have died since 2004. We brought about 3.5 liters of water and we ran out at the last\nmile going down. Here are my tips for making it more likely that you will survive:\n\n  - Go early. The first shuttles start as early as 6AM some times of the year. We got going on the hike at about 8 AM in\n    June and the first part of the trail (even before the refrigerator canyon) was shaded. This made the first part of\n    the trail much more enjoyable.\n  - Use open-finger gloves. Gloves let you hold onto, and run your hand along the chains without hurting your hands. I\n    bought some gloves on sale at REI for $12. Amazon has some nice pairs as well. Avenir Classic Cool Cycling Gloves\n    (Black, Large)\n  - Use a hydration backpack. A hydration backpack allows you to drink water while keeping your hands free. Some of the\n    spaces along the route are tight enough that you will not have space to put down a bag. I used the [Camelbak Vantage\n    Hydration\n    Pack])http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006ZV58E6\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B006ZV58E6&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanmull-20),\n    which is a lovely versatile pack.\n  - Use the three-point technique as much as possible. The three-point technique is where you always have three points\n    in contact with the ground or chain at all times. For example, both hands on the chain and one foot on the ground.\n    Or one hand on the chain and two feet on the ground.\n  - Keep your weight over your feet. It might seem counter intuitive if you are not a rock climber, but you get a lot\n    more traction if you keep your weight above your feet. Sticking your butt out while scrambling upward can help keep\n    your weight over your feet and avoid slipping.\n  - Avoid sand. Parts of the trail are covered in sand. Avoid stepping in or near these parts of the trail because sand\n    is effectively a lubricant. The one time I slipped on the trail was in a spot with sand. Luckily it was no where\n    near the edge and I did not actually fall over.\n  - Don’t look down. Some people get sick when they look down from heights. If you do, I don’t recommend going. If you\n    insist, don’t look down. Some parts are scary even for us regular folk.\n  - If you follow these tips, you should have a much more pleasant hike. Best of luck on your Angel’s Landing hike.\n" }

,{ "url": "writing-review-1\/", "title": "Writing Review #1", "text": "Writing Review #12008-12-21\n\nAs promised, I will review the writing of my latest blog entries. By reviewing on my own writing, I hope to learn more\nabout my writing and improve it. If you have any comments about my entries, I would love to hear them, and I will post\nthem in my reviews.\n\nCheap Memory Foam Mattress\n\nOne sentence that strikes me as particularly bad is, \"One was how good the bed felt underneath me, and two was the\nprice.\" My sentence construction here is very unbalanced. The first part of the sentence is a complete idea, while the\nsecond part is explained in the next sentence. When sentences become this unbalanced it becomes hard to read them.\n\nThis post has a very generic opening. I do not sound excited about this mattress, even though I really am. Starting the\npost with Tempurpedic instead of an exciting explanation of memory foam was a mistake. It would have been more\nappropriate to postpone this post until after I could make a better recommendation about the bed. Ending by saying that\nI have only slept in it for two days instead of a call to buy this mattress is a weak closing.\n\nNow that I have had two weeks to sleep in the mattress, I've found it to be extremely comfortable. I wake up without any\nback pain or soreness. Also, I can sleep in any position without feeling pain: on coil mattresses I could never sleep on\nmy side, but on memory foam I can. Sleeping on my side was especially helpful while I was sick.\n\nCutting Out the Middleman\n\nThis was one of my best posts of the group. I am passionate about cutting out middlemen everywhere and I think this\nshowed in both the length and quality of this post. I should not have opened the post by talking about the theory of\nsupply chains. This is slightly boring and actually off topic from what I discussed later. Instead, I should have made\nstrong points about why middlemen are bad. Points that I would back up in the body of the post.\n\nTitle Insurance Prices\n\nSome of the writing is repeated twice in this post. I should have worked to clean up this duplication. Also, there are\nunnecessary words in my prose. For example, \"and the person you are selling it to\" is \"the buyer.\" In addition, title\ninsurance is not an \"idea\" it is a service.\n\nConsumers reporting the prices they pay for services might make a really popular web application. The prices of services\nare very irregular and it is hard to know if you are getting cheated. By reporting and aggregating prices, people could\nbe more satisfied about the prices they pay.\n\nOpportunity Monitoring Company\n\nThe problems with this post are mostly content related. The idea behind this company is not fully thought out, so some\nparts of this post were quite vague. I did not explain why an opportunity monitoring company would be an exciting place\nto work at well enough. There was no plan to generate revenue either.\n\nThere is an additional opportunity to post explaining how the calculations done by this company would work in practice.\n\nCapital Preservation\n\nThis post was pretty crappy. Capital preservation is a good idea, but the post suffered from problems that detracted\nfrom the idea. Defining capital and income at the start of this post would have made my explanation clearer. The post\nended by talking about something unrelated to capital preservation because I got distracted talking about the behaviors\nof financially illiterate people. My use of bold text makes the post easier to skim. What might help even more would be\nto have section headings, and also more links. My posts, in general, are devoid of good links and headings, which help\nto keep a reader's attention, by breaking up large blocks of prose.\n\nSystematic Exploration\n\nI am a hypocrite for supporting the ideas in this post. I have not systematically explored my work environment even\nthough I could probably do it in less than two hours. Also, my attempted systematic explorations of the Walmart near my\napartment failed to find what I was looking for. This week I happened to find what I was looking for by random\nexploration. I made good use of the word \"you\" in this post, and I had some good examples. A lot of my other posts could\nbe improved by using anecdotes like I did in this post.\n\nAdmitting You Suck\n\nI wrote this post when I was very ill, and it shows. It is barely coherent and too short. It sucks! It would have been a\nlot nicer if I admitted in the post that I sucked, instead it reads like I am telling you that you suck, without first\nadmitting that I suck as well.\n\nCancun\n\nThis post could have a much better title. It is a travel guide to Cancun, but I instead just wrote \"Cancun\" as the\ntitle. Also, I try to appeal to every type of Cancun traveller instead of focusing on the one that I am, or ones that I\nknow I can help. My knowledge of the party scene in Cancun is totally lacking, but yet I thought I could give useful\nadvice about it. I should not have tried.\n\nI enjoyed writing about travel, so I want to write about my other experiences; like my road trip across the US, and my\ntrip to Jamaica.\n\nNon-violence in Iraq\n\nThis was a most popular post by number of comments. Jacob Lee's comment was exciting because it made me rethink\nAmerica's effect on Iraq. Also, iprefermuffins pointed out that I spelled \"Gandhi\" wrong, which is particularly lame\nbecause I had spent hours reading Wikipedia pages about Gandhi\n\nI did a good job of avoiding passive sentences in this post. Nothing is cut and dry in geopolitical problems, but\nwriting passive sentences does not spark debate or make people think. I was happy with the length of this post as well.\nI demonstrated again that I am bad at concluding blog posts. My conclusions tend to not reinforce what I have written\nand instead go off in strange directions. The reason for this is that I see that I am almost done and I rush to finish.\nI will try to focus on improving my conclusions next week.\n\nProgrammers Will Form Labor Unions\n\nI was surprised this entry did not generate any disagreement. I think this just shows how few readers I actually have at\nthis point, which is kind of disappointing. I need to focus on building my readership by writing more valuable posts.\nThis post is not particularly valuable because it is not directly applicable. It just some speculation about the future.\n\nThis post was well structured, except for the conclusion. It introduced three conditions for unionization then talked\nabout each point. Use of more examples, anecdotes and evidence would have made this post a lot more valuable.\n\nWhat I Learned Playing MUDs\n\nI like this post. One thing that could improve it are sub-headings. It is fun to recall what I learned from my hobbies\nand try to distill it into some useful form. It would be fun to make other distillations about the past. Maybe a post\nabout what I learned in college, high-school, from playing sports. All fun topics to explore in the future.\n\nGoogle Finance Definitions\n\nThis post is a departure from my others. It seems to be improperly formatted to give the best explanation: some of the\nexplanations are part of a description list while two are just paragraphs. Also, I could have added a lot more value by\ntalking about how you should interpret these numbers instead of just providing definitions for them. I just noticed that\nI failed to highlight a link in the middle of the post. With more work, this format of post could provide a lot of value\nto people.\n\nMoney Burning Charity\n\nThis post is pretty crappy. It starts off advocating for this new type of charity I invented, but as I think about it\nmore I find the idea is a bad one. After I realized it was a bad idea, I should have reformatted the post as a joke, or\nscrapped it entirely. Posting it in an inconsistent state was irresponsible of me.\n\nReader Comments\n\nMy friend \"Alan Lynn\" has this to say:\n\nI think the approach of writing a blog post every day is inherently quantity over quality, unless you have a lot of time\nto invest. You've picked some good topics recently, but the content often seems undeveloped.\n\nIf somebody finds your blog a month from now, would they find your articles valuable enough to read through your\narchives?\n\nMy current strategy is to learn to write by writing a large number of sentences. My main motivation currently is not to\nprovide value to others but to improve my writing skills and habits so that I can later provide value to others. I think\nthat posting every day is important until I get into a strong habit of posting new ideas I have.\n\nIf it is possible, I would like to increase my quality without investing more time. If I get better at researching and\nwriting content, I will be able to achieve this. I hope that I can revisit some of this underdeveloped content later and\ndevelop small sections of it.\n" }
,{ "url": "money-burning-charity\/", "title": "Money Burning Charity", "text": "Money Burning Charity2008-12-20\n\nCharities usually have a mission. The mission says who to help and how. It helps to be specific. Charities that focus on\ncleft lips tend to do better than ones focusing on heart disease. The charity I thought of is quite specific with its\nmission. The mission is to destroy all of the money donated to it.\n\nBy destroying all the money donated, this charity will be bolstering the value of the currency donated. For example,\nwhen you donate one million USD to this charity, everyone else's US Dollars become more valuable. It is the opposite of\ninflation. Instead of goods and services costing more because there are more dollars around to buy them, they cost less\nbecause there are less dollars around to buy them.\n\nBy reducing prices in general, this charity makes it easier for consumers to buy necessary items. Instead of each\npaycheck being able to buy less and less goods and services, it will be able to buy more and more.\n\nIf popular enough, it may make a slight dent in the rampant inflation caused by the central banks of the world. In fact,\nto make it more effective, instead of destroying the money donated to it, it will first invest the money and only half\nthe proceeds. This will create a machine that destroys every increasing amounts of money.\n\nUnfortunately, the burning would not negate the bureau-potism caused by the inflationary system: the system that favors\nthose who are close friends with the government by buying their goods and services with inflationary dollars. It would\nalso not help people pay off loans. Most of the money in existence in the world is because banks loaned it into\nexistence, and when they charge interest on top of the created money, it becomes impossible for people to pay off all\nthe debt in existence even by using all the credit in existence. This charity would be destroying credit, without\nquenching the debt that created it.\n" }

,{ "url": "what-i-learned-playing-muds\/", "title": "What I Learned Playing MUDs", "text": "What I Learned Playing MUDs2008-12-17\n\nMulti user dungeons (MUDs) are online games that use text as the primary means of interaction. I created a MUD called\nDeimosMUD back in the year 2000, and it is still running today. Over this time, I have spent countless hours working on\nit. The hours were spent coding new features for the game, building new worlds, and mainly dealing with people. The time\nI spent dealing with people's complaints, training people, arbitrating disputes, and punishing offenders far outweighed\nthe time I spent doing anything else. Some people would say that the reason I spent more time on these issues was\nbecause I was an inept administrator of MUDs, and they would be right. I started this game just after 8th grade!\nHandling these issues taught me a lot. Solving these human caused problems was great for learning how to deal with\npeople in general. My work helped me became a much better moderator and arbitrator. It also helped develop my leadership\nskills. The hardest people to lead are those that are working for you for free, and everyone on my MUD was volunteering.\n\nI learned that people can have entirely different motivations from you and they can end up doing things that you do not\nlike. For example, the people who made areas on my MUD, builders, would often make the equipment in their areas have\nbetter abilities than all of the available equipment. This would ensure that players would want to visit the builders'\nnew zones. The zones did not have to be fun to play, well laid out, or balanced to get players; they just needed to have\nthe best equipment. The builders wanted their new zones to be popular, but I wanted the abilities of players to not get\ninflated. Player ability inflation deprecates older areas, and makes the game easier to play which is usually a bad\nthing. I never actually solved this problem of motivations, but I think even just recognizing it was a step in the right\ndirection from my state total ignorance. If I were to try to solve this now, I would try to think of a system that set\nup larger incentives for the elements I would like to see in an area.\n\nDiscipline was something I learned a lot about as well. When I first started the game, I was very lax on discipline. I\nthought it would be okay to just sit by while people were bad mouthing me and the other MUD administration. This was\nbecause I personally believe in free speech and do not really care when other people insult me. I learned that this was\nnot the right approach at all. People who insulted the administration would take the lack of punishment from the insults\nas license to all sorts of other bad activities: harassing players, exploiting bugs, and conspiring against players and\nadministrators. I learned that the discipline for petty crimes was necessary if I wanted to head of the bigger problem;\na lot like fixing broken windows.\n\nMaking a MUD also developed my own personal game design aesthetics. At first, I favored the absurd over the realistic.\nAreas that did not make sense with the theme of the game (Medieval Fantasy) or game mechanics that were just silly, were\nfrequently made. Eventually I rejected this absurdity and started to focus more on simplicity. Instead of making more\ncomplex game mechanics, I was trying to think about what I could take out. I now believe the idea that something is done\nnot when you have added everything but when there is nothing left to take out. I feel that simple game mechanics that\nlead to complex player behavior are greatly superior to complex mechanics.\n\nI had a lot of fun with my MUD and I learned a lot from it. It was my principle hobby for at least 6 years. The end\nproduct is still around, but all the memories of the experiences and fun are hard to share. You can still, play\nDeimosMUD to get a taste of what it must have been like.\n" }
,{ "url": "programmer-labor-unions\/", "title": "Programmers Will Form Labor Unions", "text": "Programmers Will Form Labor Unions2008-12-16\n\nWe will have programmer labor unions. Labor unions arise when a workforce is stable, there are few opportunities for\nadvancement, and the owners of the businesses are achieving large returns on capital. When these three conditions occur\nprogrammers will unionize.\n\nA good number of programmers I have met just like to program. They happily write code that someone else tells them to\nwrite and they do not think about writing code for personal gain beyond a salary from their employer. If this dominant\nattitude continues, programmers will continue to have few opportunities for advancement. If a programmer does not seek\nto expand his skills beyond mere programming, she becomes interchangeable with other programmers. Another opportunity\nfor advancement is management. Programmers are often also adverse to management. This aversion decreases the\nopportunities for advancement available to the average programmer.\n\nProgramming, as a field, is just old enough that We are starting to see career programmers: people who have remained the\nsame role of writing code under someone else's management with someone else's specifications for their entire working\nlife. This is painfully similar to a career electrician or welder--two highly unionized trades. Certainly the trade of\nprogramming as a career programmer advances as new technologies become available but if these new technologies do not\nchange the attitude of the career programmer he remains without advancement opportunities.\n\nIt has been shown that large returns on capital are possible by employing a large number of programmers. Microsoft and\nGoogle have shown returns on capital that would have astounded the industrialists. These gains will only increase in the\nshort term as more career programmers are marginalized by their own commoditization. By employing more and more\nprogrammers at lower and lower wages, companies employing this strategy will achieve absurd windfalls necessary to spark\nunionization.\n\nThe biggest stopping point to unionization currently is stability of the workforce of programmers. Enough programmers do\nnot stay at the same job long enough to make unionization seem necessary. What this group of career programmers may come\nto realize though, is that even though they do not stay at the same job, they are staying at the same kind of job. The\nsame kind of job doing generally the same kind of work.\n\nAnother contributor to instability is globalization of the programmer workforce. The recent labor pool expansions in\nIndia, China, etc. have lead to a destabilization in the programmer workforce in developed countries. Jobs moving across\nthe world are hardly jobs ripe for unionization. This destabilization will not last because as the world programmer's\nstandards of living equilibrate, employers will find no refuge in lower standard of living areas.

,{ "url": "non-violent-iraq\/", "title": "Non-violence in Iraq", "text": "Non-violence in Iraq2008-12-15\n\nI have come up with a solution for how to get America out of Iraq quickly. The solution is non-violent resistance. If\nthe Iraqis decide to stop providing services and goods from Americans, and stage non-violent sit-ins at Baghdad the US\narmy will have no choice to but to leave. The Iraqis must become stronger, they must decide that it is not worth working\nand living, if they are doing so under an oppressor.\n\nPeople say that by leaving Iraq the Americans will destabilize the region. An Iraqi people strongly willed enough to\noust the Americans with non-violent resistance, is an Iraqi people strong enough to stand up against the insidious\nforeign rule from other Middle-eastern countries.\n\nThe non-violence is crucial. It is already clear that violence does not work for ousting the US army. Violent people\nwill be branded as terrorists, non-violent people will be true martyrs. People can not rally around the banner of\nviolence. They can, however, take up the cause of non-violence.\n\nThe non-violent resistance will be a public relations boon. New media always likes to cover the story of David vs\nGoliath; even more so if David does not have a sling. Imagine how it would look to see reports of the US army firing\ninto a non-violent army. Think of how badly the Khudai Khidmatgar made the British look. Images of the American army\ndoing the same would shatter the American conscience of being the world 'goody-two-shoes', and bring us Americans back\nto reality.\n\nThe ousting not only must be non-violent but it must also be secular. If the Americans are ousted for non-secular\nreasons, the non-secular ruling class will have even more power in the ensuing government. The Americans should be\nousted because they have no right to be in Iraq. Under international law (think not of the charade of UN resolutions),\nit is clear that America is an invading imperialist with respect to Iraq. Invading imperialists should be repelled no\nmatter what their religion or social practices are. It should be reason enough that Americans have no right to be in the\ncountry. There is no need to bring up such inanities as Americans being infidels or spawn of Satan, or whatever\ngibberish these religious folks come up with. Do it for secular reasons.\n\nWhere is Iraq's Gandhi? Where is the leader who will bring about this non-violent uprising that will free Iraq from its\ncomplacency and ill fate? Any Iraqi could be the next Gandhi. All they need to do is stand up and be the first not to\ncast the first stone. The first to preach of non-violence and throw down their work and take up the cause of non-violent\nresistance against this foreign oppressor.\n" }

I have visited Cancun four times in my\nlife and each time I had a wonderful time.\n\nIf you are going to Cancun to party (which I never have), I recommend you stay at a hotel that is all-inclusive. If you\nget your drinking done during the day time you will not be so compelled to waste your money on the over priced drinks at\nthe clubs and bars. One hotel that I stayed at, the Tucancun, is a good choice for this schedule.\n\nIf you are not into partying you should stay at a hotel closer to Playa Del Carmen. The beaches are much nicer and Playa\nDel Carmen is a closer to the Mayan ruins and amusement parks. Most of the travel packages you get will include a bus\nride to your hotel when you get there and back to the airport in the end, so there is no need to rent a car. Also, if\nthat wasn't enough, there is an excellent public van system called the \"cambia\" which is subsidized by the government\nmaking it dirt cheap to go anywhere along the highway west of Playa Del Carmen. You can even take the \"cambia\" into\nCancun.\n\nOne place you must visit if you go to Cancun is Tulum. The Mayan ruins at Tulum are excellently preserved and well\nmaintained. The site has bathroom facilities and ethnic shopping opportunities. The best part of Tulum is that you can\nclimb down the cliffs overlooking the ocean to a beautiful white sand beach. The water is perfect so bring your bathing\nsuit.\n\nIf you are interested in seeing more Mayan ruins, there is also Chichen Itza. It features a Mayan castle (Castillo),\na 150 meter ball court, many other well preserved ruins. The time I visited they were still letting people ascend the\nCastillo, but after some tourists got injured by falling, the stairways have been closed to the public. The Castillo is\nbuilt so that during the spring and fall equinoxes, the sun will hit it just right and make it look like a giant serpent\nis crawling down the side of the castle. If you are flexible with your trip timing this could be an excellent time to\ngo.\n\nThe city of Playa Del Carmen offers some newly built up-scale shopping areas, and a ferry to Isla de Mujeres. Isla de\nMujeres is a island just big enough to have its own airport. It also sports a marine ecological preserve where\nsnorkeling is allowed. Back when I visited last, the preserve still had some nice fish and other life to look at. With\nthe continual snorkeling that they are allowing, it is hard to believe that it will stay nice forever.\n\nMexico is on good terms with the USA, but bringing passports is a must. A couple of times my dad only brought birth\ncertificates for my sister and I, but this proved to be a hassle and usually resulted in automatic customs inspection.\n" }

Systematic exploration is the process of exploring every possible dimension of the place you are\nin. A simple example is that you go to the grocery store. Instead of visiting only the aisles that contain things of\ninterest to you, visit every aisle in sequence. While you are doing this hold in your mind the intention that you will\nfind something cool that you've never seen before. This works for new grocery stores and ones you have frequently used.\nOne time, I was in Walmart and I decided to systematically explore the grocery section. Just from this decision I found\nsome great textured vegetable protein hidden in the freezer section.\n\nThis technique also works if you start a new job. When you start the job, visit every person's office, visit every\nworkstation on the shop floor, look inside every tool chest. People might think you are nuts but in no time you will not\nhave to interrupt people to find things for you and soon you might even be telling others where things are.\n\nSystematic exploration can help you learn more about where you live. Instead of just driving or walking from where you\nare to where you want to go, take different routes each time so you can explore where different shops and entertaining\nthings are. Just last week I found an awesome view of east Las Vegas by systematically exploring some roads. I also\nstumbled upon a large yard that was completely filled with Christmas lights and people touring a chocolate factory. Now\nI know how to find a great view and a chocolate factory, which was totally worth the extra gasoline I had to use to do\nit.\n\nAll of us have a little extra time each week, extend your commute a little bit so that you can find something\ninteresting. Consider exploring to be a fun date in itself. Instead of planning where to go say, \"How about we go\nexploring?\"\n" }
,{ "url": "capital-preservation\/", "title": "Capital Preservation", "text": "Capital Preservation2008-12-11\n\nOne financial skill that I have been most interested in lately is capital preservation. Capital preservation means that\nonce you decide to invest some money, you try to never spend that money on a non-investment related activity, or lose it\non bad investment. Operating from this frame of mind does two things for you. One, it keeps you thinking about ways to\ninvest your money, and two it forces you to save for the future.\n\nOne of my life goals is to invest more and more of my net income over the course of my life. As a start out, it should\nbe tough to save more than 50% of my current income, but as I start earning more money, living more efficiently, and\nmaking more money from investment opportunities, this percentage should get higher. There really is no limit to how high\nthis percentage can be, for instance, if you are one of the richest people in the world, you have so much money that you\ncan even possibly spend it all on yourself, so you have to invest it. One of the richest people in the world might have\na capital preservation rate of 99.999%.\n\nIncreasing your capital preservation rate is a good idea because the more capital you have, the more additional income\nyou can generate from it. Take the simple example of a savings account. When your account earns interest, if you keep\nthe interest in that account, that interest also earns interest. It is called compounding -- one of the most important\nfinancial concepts. The more capital you have that generates additional capital, the higher and more quickly your\ncapital preservation rate will climb.\n\nMost financially illiterate people actually try to do the exact opposite. Instead of trying to increase their capital\npreservation rate, they try to decrease it. If you spend every dollar you make on non-investment activities, your\ncapital preservation rate is 0%. It does not matter if you make $1 million dollars a year, or $10 dollars a year. If you\nspend it all, your capital preservation rate is 0%.\n\nIt is actually possible to have a negative capital preservation rate. If you spend more than you make on non-investment\nactivities you have a negative rate. It does not matter if you are spending money that was in a bank account, or money\nyou got on credit ( credit card, loan, etc.). Either way you have a negative capital preservation rate.\n\nThe most illiterate people actually try to maximize their negative capital preservation rate. They will try to borrow as\nmuch money as they can from banks, and credit cards for non-investment expenditures. While they think they are living\nlike a rich person, really they are as far from it as possible. A truly rich person tries to maximize their capital\npreservation rate, the richest have a rate so close to 100% that they stop caring.\n" }
,{ "url": "opportunity-monitoring-company\/", "title": "Opportunity Monitoring Company", "text": "Opportunity Monitoring Company2008-12-10\n\nOften I think of ideas for companies that sound great. Upon further inspection, I find that there is some small economic\ndetail that needs to be true before the idea can be a success. For example, my friend David Grayson and I thought up an\nidea for putting LED stickers on the bottom of glass beer bottles. We figured that we could sell them to beer\ndistributors as a way to promote their glass bottle offerings. The trouble is, the cost of LEDs plus batteries plus\nstickers is currently too much to make the offer tenable. The price of the promotion needs to be some small fraction of\nthe gross margin on the bottles for this to be attractive to the distributors.\n\nWe had this idea about a year ago and we haven't though much about it since. It would be great if there was a company\nthat aggregated ideas like the one above and came up with the criteria for when the idea would actually be economically\nviable. The company would monitor the inputs: the prices of LEDs, stickers, and batteries. It would also monitor the\nconstraints: the gross margin on glass beer bottles, the total consumption of these bottles. The company might even work\nwith distributors to get them on board before the idea even becomes tenable. The company would then take these inputs\nand constraints and come up with a equation for when the idea would make economic sense.\n\nBy periodically reviewing a large pool of ideas with similar structure to the one above, the company would routinely\nfind ideas that have recently become economically viable. Having a large pool of ideas to select from that have recently\nbecome economically viable would be a very valuable service. The company could distribute this value in the form of\ninformation, or in the form of implementing the idea using one of its subsidiaries.\n\nThis type of company would be extremely exciting to work for because they'd always be dealing with the newest possible\nideas that could actually work. It would be exciting to run a report daily, and see that two of our 1 million stored\nideas have become economically viable over night.\n" }

,{ "url": "cutting-out-the-middleman\/", "title": "Cutting Out the Middleman", "text": "Cutting Out the Middleman2008-12-09\n\nCutting out the middleman is one of the best things you can do to improve service, satisfaction, price and overall\nsystem efficiency. In supply chain theory there is a concept called the Bullwhip Effect. It says that the more middlemen\nyou introduce into a supply chain the less efficient it can be. As a distributor makes an order he causes demand to whip\nup as seen the upstream supply chain members and even when obeying the most efficient ordering algorithm, the upstream\nmember has to order more than the demand, leading to a amplification of the demand. Left unchecked this demand can get\nout of hand and become a giant surplus.\n\nMiddlemen are not only inefficient, but they are also costly. Consider how many people are required to deliver a piece\nof real estate(e.g. your home for example) to you. You have the 2 realtors and their brokerages, 2 lawyers and their\nfirms, a house inspector, a pest inspector, two banks, a title insurance company, an appraiser, and city, county, state,\nand federal government agents. Each of these people makes enough money to do real estate transactions full time (except\nthe government, they do not know how to make money.). People are the largest expense of any company, and they certainly\nare the largest expense of any real estate transaction. If you can get rid of any of these middlemen or decrease their\ncompensation you can save a lot of money on a real estate transaction. One example to look into, if you are selling your\nhome, is Flat-fee MLS listing. With a flat listing fee you can save up to 3% of the sale price of your home.\n\nMiddlemen can also leave you less satisfied. When is the last time you bought a new car and felt satisfied? With the way\ncar dealers haggle, you know that someone else out there is getting a better price, and you always have to weigh the\nstress induced by haggling you before you get into it. The fact is car dealers make their money by selling cars in\nvolume and since they buy their cars at a fixed price from the manufacturers, they care a lot about selling each car for\nas much as they can. It would be great if we could cut out the car dealerships and buy cars from an automotive\ndepartment store? This is what CarMax has done with used cars. They sell all makes of used cars at a reasonable sticker\nprice and they do not haggle. This leaves their customers feeling more satisfied: they got the same deal anyone else\nwould have gotten, and they did not have deal with the stress of haggling.\n\nThe effect of the Internet that has done the most good for humanity has been removing middlemen. It is has become so\neasy to set up an online store that many factories and manufacturers are beginning to sell their goods online. Even if\nthey haven't begun to do so, the new manufacturers are.\n\nA lot of great businesses were founded with the idea of taking out the middleman. GEICO takes out the middleman of\nhaving an insurance agent. The Foam Factory sells cheap memory foam mattresses direct. If you are thinking of starting a\nbusiness, one of the surest ways to achieve customer goodwill is to take out a middleman. When you take out a middleman,\ncustomers go from spending more money to less. When you save customers money, they love you.\n\nWhat middlemen have you dealt with recently and how could you have avoided it?\n" }
,{ "url": "memory-foam-mattress\/", "title": "Memory Foam Mattress", "text": "Memory Foam Mattress2008-12-08\n\nThe Tempurpedic mattress commercials have always intrigued me. The promise is great: a material that conforms to your\nbody without poking you the way coiled spring mattresses do. This was enough to make me want to try one. I went to a\nlocal mattress store to try one and was amazed by two things. One was how good the bed felt underneath me, and two was\nthe price. The beds cost at least 5 times as much as comparable coiled spring mattresses. This was confusing because the\nprocess for making a foam bed is actually a simpler process than constructing many metal coils and putting them in the\nright orientation. With a foam bed all you need is a mold of the right size and the right mix of materials at the\ncorrect temperature. My gut told me someone would be selling these beds for less.\n\nAfter searching the internet for about a day, I stumbled upon The Foam Factory's website for Memory Foam Mattresses.\nWith prices 5 times less than Tempurpedic, comparable quality, and free shipping these beds are amazing. I bought a\nTwin 5\" LUX-HQ 4\" 4.5LB Memory for $254.99 + 20 for the nicer cover and had it shipped to me.\n\nThe mattress came compressed in tight plastic wrapping, which made it take up less space than it does now. After I took\nit out of the plastic wrap it started to expand. Once fully expanded it was ready to use, and felt great to lie down in.\nThe strangest sensation is when you go to plop down on your bed, you expect it to feel the same way a coiled spring\nmattress feels, but it feels totally different. So far I haven't gotten used to this difference.\n\nI have only slept in it for 2 night so far, and I don't have any complaints, but stay tuned for an update.\n" }
,{ "url": "compact-flourescent-lightbulb-efficiency\/", "title": "Compact Flourescent Lightbulb Efficiency", "text": "Compact Flourescent Lightbulb EfficiencyCompact Fluorescent Lightbulbs (CFLs) are quite the rage in home lighting these\ndays. I've replaced most of the bulbs in my house with CFLs. Let us examine the energy and financial efficiencies of\nthese bulbs.\n\nEnergy Efficiencies\n\nThe input of lightbulbs is their power consumption. Power consumption is measured in Watts. The output of lightbulbs is\nhow bright it is. Brightness is measured in lumens.\n\nThe most common type of CFL is the 13 watt lightbulb. It is the replacement for the common 60 Watt incandescent bulb.\nTable 1 shows relevant inputs and outputs for these two bulbs.\n\n|  | Input Power (Watt) | Output Light (Lumen) | Luminous Efficacy (Lumen\/Watt) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Incandescent | 60 | 850 | 850\/60 ≅ 14.16 |\n| Compact Fluorescent | 13 | 900 | 900\/13 ≅ 69.23 |\n\nCFLs have a higher lumen output and a lower watt input resulting in almost 5 times greater efficacy. Note though, that I\ndon't say efficiency. Efficiency is a dimensionless quantity, and Lumen\/Watt is not dimensionless. If you had a\nlightbulb that gave off 1000 Lumens at 9 Watts. You would compute its luminous efficacy to be 111 (1000\/9). 111 is\ngreater than the maximum energy efficiency you could have (100%). If your lightbulb is greater than 100% efficient it\nwould mean that it actually created energy out of nowhere.\n\nTo compute a bulbs efficiency we need the theoretical maximum luminous efficacy. The theoretical maximum represents a\nlightbulb that turned all of its power into visible light photons. The theoretical maximum luminous efficacy is 683.002\nLumen\/Watt. Give this, the luminous efficiency is given by the luminous efficacy divided by the maximum efficacy. The\nresults of this computation are seen in Table 2.\n\n|  | Luminous Efficiency |\n| --- | --- |\n| Incandescent | 14.16\/683.002 ≅ 2% |\n| Compact Fluorescent | 69.23\/683.002 ≅ 10% |\n\nSo in the case of CFLs 10% of the power consumed is being converted into light. Ideally we want 100% of the energy to be\nconverted into light, but 10% is 5 times better than the incandescent bulbs at 2%.\n\nIf we swap incandescents for the more efficient CFLs we will realize a significant energy savings. Incandescents use 60\nwatts and CFLs use 13 watts. The difference is 47 watts. If we take that over the useful life of a CFL bulb, 10,000\nhours, we get 470 kW hours of savings. At a usage rate of 3 hours per day, you can use 51.5 kW hours fewer a year.\n\nFrom an energy perspective, CFLs represent a significant improvement over prior bulbs. Energy savings alone is not a\nreason to do something though. If CFLs cost $500 per bulb you would not want to pay for one. Let's see if we can really\nafford these bulbs.\n\nFinancial Efficiencies\n\nTo decide whether to invest in CFLs we need to decide if the Net Present Value (NPV) of the bulb switch investment is\npositive. To upgrade the bulbs capital must be invested. Since you have to have at least one kind of bulb the capital\ninvested is the difference in price between a CFL bulb ($2.74) and a incandescent bulb ($0.36). This investment yields\ntwo distinct returns. The first is the energy savings. If we assume an energy cost of 10 cents per kilowatt hour, the\nswitch saves 43 cents each month. The second is replacement savings. Incandescent bulbs are rated for 1000 hours of use\nand CFLs are rated for 10,000 hours of use. Each year we forgo the replacement cost of an incandescent bulb.\n\nSince cash in the future is not as good as cash now (cash now can be invested in other things) we must use NPV to\ncalculate how much this is worth to us. The NPV calculation discounts cash returns in the future. The rate of discount\nis based on some rate of return we think we can get doing something else. For instance, at the time of writing the US 10\nyear bond is at 3.83%. So if you invested your capital in a US bond instead of a lightbulb would you come out ahead?\nThat's what we aim to ask by using NPV. It turns out that the NPV for the CFL investment is $44.73. Since this number is\npositive, it means that investing in CFLs is a good option compared to investing in US Bonds.\n\nIt is useful to look at your break even point. Say you are only living in a place for a short time. If you move before\nthe break even point you will have wasted cash buying CFLs. If you move after the break-even point, the CFLs will be\nworth it to you. The break even point is the time when the Net Present Value first becomes positive. In this case, the\nbreak even point for the CFL investment is at 8 months. At 8 months, you will have recouped your investment and made 17\ncents.\n\nAnother useful number is your return on investment. The capital outlay is $2.37 and the total return is $57.42. The\nreturn on investment is 2422% over 9 years.\n\nCFLs appear to be a good investment vehicle for people looking to earn great returns on their capital. Unfortunately it\ndoes not scale well. Once you have invested capital in all of your lightbulbs you cannot continue to achieve such large\nreturns on investment.\n" }

The basic principle behind this approach is to quickly write regular expressions to search for every\npossible word you can make a specific part of the board. By cating a scrabble word list into a pipe and using egrep with\nregular expressions, you can quickly and easily match patterns against your tiles and the state of the board.\n\n%p Quick example:\n\n%pre %code.html.language-bash :preserve $ wget http:\/\/www.ryantm.com\/scrabble-word-list.tar.gz $ tar -xvzf\nscrabble-word-list.tar.gz $ cat scrabble-word-list | egrep \"^A[EPABVT]{4}$\" ABATE\n\n%p We've found a valid 5 letter scrabble word that starts with an A (^ means start of line), contains 4 of the set\nE,P,A,B,V,T ($ means end of word). Expanding on this concept you can do all sorts of awesome patterns.\n\n%p Say you want to make a word that goes from what you currently have to a triple word score 5 tiles away that connects\nto a D. You just do something like this:\n\n%pre %code.html.language-bash :preserve $ cat scrabble-word-list | egrep \"^[EABTTE]*D$\" ABATED BATTED BETTED TABBED\nTATTED TEATED\n\n%p Then suddenly you've got a list of words that work for what you want. I did * here instead of {4} * means match as\nmany characters as you can. It's usually a good idea to start with * and narrow it down with {number} if you need to.\nYou might notice that one of them doesn't work (TABBED), because you don't have two B's. The regular expression matcher\ndoesn't care how many times you put a letter inside a set ([]) and it will match it as many times as it can. You can\nfilter these words quickly yourself though, because you know you don't have two B's.\n\n%h3 The General Principle\n\n%ol %li Take what letters you have an form at set: [BZTQEAI] %li Find a starting or ending place: ^ACE or Y$ %li Put it\ntogether with the number of letters you want to use: \"^ACE[BZTQEAI]*\" %li Double check the word with reality %li Repeat\nuntil you are satisfied with your word score.\n" }

While I agree that Yahoo Browser Plus is more\nwell put together than Google Gears, both in terms of downloading and installing modules, and that their model for\ndesigning new modules is more open-source and organic, they need to get their software on computers.\n\n%h2 Developers, Developers, Developers, Developers %p Getting this Browser++ software on computers has already been\nshown to be quite difficult. Until these add-ons get close to the market penetration of flash they are going to have a\nparticularly tough time attracting developers. I was also surprised that while Yahoo Browser Plus seems to be better\nthan Google Gears in a lot of ways, they have no version targeting Ubuntu Linux, something that Google Gears has been\nserious about since the beginning. If you want to attract good developers to your product, you need to run on Linux.\n\n%h2 Socket Applications Won't Suck as Much %p A web application that I'm working on would particularly benefit from the\nwidespread penentration of the Browser++ software. I'm making a browser based MUD client. Right now the only way to\nreasonably do this is to have a persistent socket server on the web server that is hooked up to the browser via AJAX.\nThis works pretty well, but an version built similarly to Yahoo's IRC chat, would shuttle most of my server load to the\nusers computers, where they have typically resided for socket based clients in the past. This seems like it would be a\ngreat candidate for a Browser++ application but there are a couple of hangups so far.\n\n%h2 Future of Browser++ %p I am particularly hesitant to use Browser++ tools to develop my web applications, because the\nweb is supposed to work everywhere. If the software doesn't have enough penetration it doesn't make sense to build a\nsolution that you want to work everywhere on these tools. The unfortunate problem with this is that it is a chicken and\negg problem. Macromedia solved this problem by integrating Flash over many many years. They didn't just release Flash\nand then say \"okay now the game has changed, everyone can run streaming video on the web.\" This happened over time. The\ngame hasn't changed, it is changing.\n" }

I've been using HAML since back when I made my Assassins Game Hosting\nService in 2007. If you are still using ERB or some other templating language for your web applications here is why you\nshould given HAML a try.\n\n%p HAML gets rid of end tags. By using Python like indentation it removes the need for you to type all of those pesky\nHTML endtags. Also, it lets you quickly see the nesting of tabs simply by the indentation of the line you are on. This\nquick look at nesting is espcially helpful when your HTML files start to get longer than 80 lines or so.\n\n%p HAML generates pretty source. I am anal about how my HTML souce looks. I want it to be indented with spaces at every\nnesting point. If you've ever seen the HTML source for a webpage generated in on of the terrible, horrible WYSIWYG\neditors, you know exactly what I don't want. Every time I look at the source of pages generated by those tools a little\npiece of me dies. HAML is the complete opposite of this. It generates the cleanest possible HTML document it can. The\nfile format convinces you to write cleanly, but it also smooths over some errors you could make. For instance, if you\ninclude unnecessary newlines in your source file, HAML removes them, leaving on the effectful newlines.\n\n%p HAML is integrated with Ruby. ERB's Ruby integration is a joke. All it does it execute Ruby between <% %> with a\nlittle extra handling for loops and if statements. HAML's Ruby integration is like a Red Corvette. You can use = for\nruby code with output, or == for ruby strings, or - for Ruby code without output. Also, now with HAML 2.0 error handling\nfor Ruby and HAML is great a well.\n\n%p HAML installation is easy. You can try HAML out right away with little effort, and no conflict with your current\nRails installs just do the following:\n\n%pre %code.html.language-bash gem install haml --no-ri\n\n%pre %code.html.language-bash haml --rails path\/to\/app\n\n%p I should also mention that HAML is used in my favorite static HTML generator, Staticmatic.\n" }

But that isn't want I want to talk\nabout. I want to talk about the growing amount of evidence that strikes down the idea that programmers are smarter than\nthe average person.\n\n%p There is a certain mythos surrounding the idea that some of us can \"talk to the machines,\" while others cannot. This\nmisunderstanding has been capitalized by many programming types to act in a condescending manner against the people who\ndo not know about computers. This has led to the mistaken belief that programmers are smarter than the average person.\nThis is not the case. Programmers are humans like everyone else who have chosen to study an area very deeply. Many other\nhumans have chosen to study other areas deeply as well, for instance, have you ever met a sculptor, or a advertiser, or\na politician? Every area where people are engaged they are studying things at a deeper level than average. This deeper\nlevel of study does not make them smarter, it just means they have more contextual information. Now that I've introduced\nthis flawed belief of programmer intelligence, I'd like to offer some evidence that caused me to write this article.\n\n%p When Google release their App Engine, they made a Google Code issue tracker for it. This tracker has since, at the\nsuggestion of Google employees, become a dumping ground for feature requests for GAE. One feature, which I was\nparticularly interested about--being a ruby programmer--, is Ruby support. Now Google Code ranks issues on the issue\npage by the number of people that have starred an issue and starring an issue lets you receive updates when the issue's\nstatus changes (i.e. the feature is implemented). Unfortunately this also means you receive comments every time someone\ncomments to the thread, and unfortunately as well, there are a lot of average Ruby programmers that showed up on this\nissue thread. The result is that since I have starred the issue, I've received over 300 emails from people who have\nwritten comments that say:\n\n%blockquote +1\n\n%p Yep that's right, that's all it says. I've been receiving them at what seems like two a minute, though that's an\nexaggeration. People have tried to quell the mob of idiots by numerous posts telling people to stop, and that it only\ncounts if you star it, but no one listens. They just keep posting \"+1\" by the hundreds. While these actions were\nsurprising to me, they should not have been. People are going to keep following the crowd and writing plus one because\nthey are people. Programmers aren't different or better. Programmers are still humans.\n\n%p One last thing I'd like to say that is probably the reason programmers have thought so highly of themselves and in\nsome cases acted condescendingly to non-programmers. I believe that computer programming is an essential skill, along\nthe lines of literacy, and speaking. The reason I categorize it with these is because, just like writing, reading and\nspeaking, programming is game changing. With computer programming people can take an idea and propagate it massively and\nautomatically. Properly programming something can change the way every other human who interacts with that program\nbehaves and lives. This is powerful stuff that shouldn't be relegated to one group of skilled persons.\n\n%p Anyone with programming skills can work to automate their job of doing menial tasks. For example, when I worked at\nCaterpillar as an engineering intern, they had about 3 people who's primary job was to make charts and give\npresentations to management about these charts. The charts graphed the quality of the machines we were shipping and the\nmanufacturing defects that were caught. I noticed that these 3 people were spending at least 3 hours a day using excel\nto generate these charts. So I created a Visual Basic program (the only programming language I had available to me) to\ngenerate these charts automatically in a fraction of the time. The reason I bring this up is not that I think these\npeople should have been writing programs to do their graphs for them. I bring it up because what if they could? What if\nthey could sit down and automate the task in front of them, and then move on to doing other useful activities for the\ncompany.\n\n%p This behavior of automation of jobs at the lowest level is why I say programming changes the game like reading,\nwriting and speaking. When people at the lowest level learned to read and write it changed the game. Literate people can\ncommunicate much more effectively with their peers and get their ideas across to a lot of people. This idea automation\nthrough literacy is paralleled by task automation through computer programming. Look at what this means, just as you\ncan't have an elite group of scribes that does all your information dissemination, you can't have an elite group of\nprogrammers to do your job automation. The idea of a programmer as a skill or trade needs to be broken down before we\ncan see the true gains in productivity that computers promise.\n\n%p So I kinda jumped around a bit here, I first cut down programmers to average, then I said, \"wouldn't it be great if\nthe average person knew how to program.\" I guess those ideas a bit hypocritical but they both serve to explain why I\nthink that programmers aren't as elite as they signal to others, and that others need to learn programming. I can hear\nit every time someone goes, \"ooh I'm not good with computers.\"\n" }

,{ "url": "your-own-fast-image-gallery-on-rails\/", "title": "your own fast image gallery on rails", "text": "your own fast image gallery on rails%p If you've ever used Facebook's photo application you might have wondered how they\nmake the images go so fast. Since I wanted to have fast viewing of our snapshot galleries over at Brawl Snapshots, I set\nout to figure out how to do it.\n\n%p The main component of a fast gallery is caching. By telling the browser to load images in hidden divs before they are\nactually displayed to the user, the browser cache is primed for the quick switch.\n\n%p The way you request these images in the background is the meat of the problem and the solution depends on what you\nare trying to do. With Facebook, each gallery has a limited number of photos in it, so Facebook loads all of the imag\nURLs, comments, and other meta data when you look at the first photo in the gallery. In the case of Brawl Snapshots this\napproach wouldn't work because some of our galleries have over 4000 images in them. Loading and rendering the meta-data\nfor 4000 images just to view one would be a little wasteful.\n\n=image_tag \"fast-gallery-requests.png\"\n\n%p Fig 1: Firebug shows AJAX requests from visiting one image\n\n%p So instead of loading all the data up front I opted to use some AJAX requests to populate my cache as needed. When\nyou go to a image in the Brawl Snapshot Gallery, it first loads the image you are on then it uses AJAX to asynchronously\nload the next and previous image in the background. After those finish we load the next's next and previous's previous\nimage as well (see figure 1). This gives our viewers a buffer of two really quick images, which gives us ample time to\nload some more for all but the quickest users.\n\n%p I will try to explain the essential components.\n\n%h3 1. The Populator (populates the cache when needed)\n\n%pre %code.html.language-javascript :preserve window.onload = function() { if (YAHOO.env.ua.ie || YAHOO.env.ua.gecko ||\nYAHOO.env.ua.webkit) { setInterval(populate, 200); }\n\n    function populate() {\n      var items = $('items');\n      if (needsNext() &amp;&amp; gettingMoreNext == false) {\n        id = lastObject(items).id;\n        gettingMoreNext = true;\n        new Ajax.Request('\/snapshots\/'+id+'\/next?'+queryString, {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:'get'});\n      }\n\n      if (needsPrevious() &amp;&amp; gettingMorePrevious == false) {\n        id = firstObject(items).id\n        gettingMorePrevious = true;\n        new Ajax.Request('\/snapshots\/'+id+'\/previous?'+queryString, {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:'get'});\n      }\n  }\n\n%p I set the populate function to run every 200 milliseconds with the setInterval() function. Inside the populate\nfunction we test if we need to get more, or if we are already getting more snapshot pages. If we aren't then we launch\nan AJAX request to get more. When the AJAX requests return the scripts inside them are automatically evaluated. The code\non the server side looks like this:\n\n%pre %code.html.language-ruby :preserve def previous item_parial = render_to_string(:partial=>\"snapshots\/show\",\n:locals=>{:snapshot=>@snapshot} render :update do |page| page.insert_html :top, 'items', item_partial page <<\n\"newStuff('previous');\" end end\n\n%p What this does is push the new snapshot into the top of the #items div, and then notify our page that it worked by\ncalled newStuff. Previous pushes onto the top of the #items div, and Next pushes onto the bottom of the #items div. This\norientation is important because it lets us navigate through the cache later.\n\n%h3 The Navigator\n\n%p If you've followed these rough steps and modified them for your needs, you should have a list of divs inside an\n#items div that are in gallery order. Now you want to navigate through them using Javascript. To do this we have to make\nuse of the Yahoo! UI Library: Browser History Manager which will give you cross browser history and make the back button\nwork. Without this library it is very hard to make the back button work on a Javascript navigated gallery. Luckily Yahoo\nlets you only include the parts of its libraries upon which Browser History Manager Depends:\n\n%pre %code.html.language-html :preserve <script src=\"http:\/\/yui.yahooapis.com\/2.5.1\/build\/yahoo\/yahoo.js\"> <script\nsrc=\"http:\/\/yui.yahooapis.com\/2.5.1\/build\/event\/event.js\"> <script\nsrc=\"http:\/\/yui.yahooapis.com\/2.5.1\/build\/history\/history.js\"> <iframe id=\"yui-history-iframe\"> <input\nid=\"yui-history-field\" type=\"hidden\" \/> %p This code only needs to be included once for your gallery viewer, not for\neach item. Now let's look at the top of the fast.js file where we do some more history initializations\n\n%pre %code.html.language-javascript :preserve function stateChange(state) { if (ignoreOneChange) { ignoreOneChange =\nfalse; return; } var ar = state.split(\"\/\"); var our_id = \"\";\n\n    for(piece in ar)\n      if (ar[piece].indexOf &amp;&amp; ar[piece].indexOf(\"?\") != -1)\n        our_id = ar[piece].split('?')[0];\n\n    toElm = document.getElementById(our_id);\n    if (toElm)\n      itemTo(document.getElementById(our_id),false);\n    else\n      window.location = state\n  }\n\n  YAHOO.util.History.register(\"items\", window.location.toString(), stateChange);\n  YAHOO.util.History.initialize(\"yui-history-field\", \"yui-history-iframe\");\n\n  var bookmarkedState = YAHOO.util.History.getBookmarkedState('items');\n  if (bookmarkedState != null)\n    window.location = bookmarkedState;\n\n%p stateChange is a function that I register with the history manager to be called every time the browser's location\nchanges. The purpose of stateChange is synchronize the state of the browser with the history, so this is why if the\nrequested spot in history is in the current cache we immediately jump to that image, otherwise we have to tell that page\nto load with window.location. Then I make sure there is no current bookmarkedState. If someone were to bookmark an AJAX\nsnapshot with ID 30 the URL might look something like: http:\/\/bs.com\/snapshots\/10#\/snapshots\/30 so you can see why you\nmight want to revert this to http:\/\/bs.com\/snapshots\/30. You need to do this since web servers are not sent any part of\nthe URL after the octothorpe(#) you would end up at snapshot 10 when you wanted to be at snapshot 30.\n\n%p The last thing to cover is how to insert something into the history. Basically whenever we click a Next link we run\nsome javascript. In this case we run nextItem(), which calls updateURL if it is successful.\n\n%pre %code.html.language-javascript :preserve function updateUrl() { var newState =\n\"\/snapshots\/\"+currentItem.id+\"?\"+queryString; if ($('yui-history-iframe')\n$('yui-history-iframe').contentWindow.document.title = document.title; YAHOO.util.History.navigate(\"items\", newState); }\n\n%p This tells the history manager to navigate to the new state. We also set the title of the iframe here so that the\nhistory in Internet Explorer contains the page titles. When the url is updated we need to make sure that the title of\nthe page is updated as well. In order to do this I have an element inside each item div that contains the title it\nshould be, and then I look it up to put as the document title when that snapshot is viewed.\n\n%p Well that about sums up everything I learned about fast galleries. Hopefully this helps you make fast galleries on\nyour own site.\n" }
,{ "url": "why-i-stopped-reading-the-newspaper\/", "title": "why i stopped reading the newspaper", "text": "why i stopped reading the newspaper%p It's been about 4 years since I stopped watching TV regularly, and about half a\nyear since I stopped reading the Newspaper. My reasons for stopping are similar to my reasons for not drinking alcohol.\nI believe that you need a reason to exhibit an action and you don't need a reason to not exhibit an action. When someone\nasks me, \"Why don't you drink.\" I say, \"I need a reason to drink, not a reason to stay sober.\" I try to extend this\nthought process to many of my other habits. %p The idea is that you should examine the things that you've learned to do,\nyour habits, and make sure you have reasons for doing so. I'm not suggesting you go through all of your habits at once.\nDoing so would be counter-productive because you can't possible think about all of your habits at once, there are too\nmany! Instead, just look at ones that are taking up a lot of your time, and are higher level behaviors. What I mean is\nthat you shouldn't examine why you use your left hand to write. You should examine why you go to work everyday, or why\nyou wake up and read the newspaper every morning, or why when you come home from work you sit down and watch television.\n\n%p Let's do a thought experiment now. Say you want to examine newspaper reading. If you agree with what I've said above,\nyou need to look for a reason to read it.\n\n%p Newspaper Attractors (ranked most useful to least useful):\n\n%ul %li Can converse easily with other newspaper readers %li Tells you the sentiment of the masses %li May contain a few\nuseful ideas or trends %li Might miss out on something\n\n%p Newspaper Detractors (most painful to least painful):\n\n%ul %li False positive on idea or trend %li Takes time to read %li Encourages emotional response rather than active\nthinking\n\n%p It's nice to be able to converse with people about current events because it gives you something novel and common to\ntalk about. However with some thought, it is usually not hard to find something that is novel and common to talk about.\nEspecially if you can make yourself genuinely interested in the activities of other people. If you are interested in\ntheir activities you instantly have a communal interest.\n\n%p The only reason to know the sentiment of the masses, or the trends is so that you can go against them. Following the\ntrends will just put you in the same boat as other mindless people who read the newspaper. To do anything useful in\nlife, you need to buck the trends, follow the unbeaten path. This reminds me of the phrase:\n\n%blockquote %p If you keep doing what you've always done, you'll keep getting what you've always gotten.\n\n%p Only when you change yourself and not follow the trends can you accomplish something that is actually newsworthy.\n\n%p Now look at the detractors, how much time do you have to spend reading the newspaper every day just to get a little\nnugget of truth from the steaming pile of crap and hype? People I know spend anywhere from 15 minutes to 30 minutes a\nday reading the newspaper. I'm sure other people read more. If you do this everyday it really starts to add up. Think\nabout what would happen if you instead used that time to exercise or just sit and meditate about your life. You'd be\nengaged in activities that have direct applicability to your life and survival, instead of reading about some esoteric\nfar off conception of other humans.\n\n%p Even with the time issue aside, you can get false positives from the newspaper. If I had a dollar for every time the\nBusiness section of the Chicago Tribune changed from Bull to Bear on the front page, I'd be a very rich man. What the\nnewspaper tries to convince you are sure trends are actually just the feelings and emotions of other humans. Lots of\nexperimental evidence has shown that humans can't predict much of anything useful about the future. This is doubly true\nwhen you are trying to predict what other humans will do. When you predict the future, the other humans are too, which\ncreates a very chaotic environment that the so called liberal \"sciences\" have made little inroads on.\n\n%p I don't trust the journalist to make predictions about events just like I don't expect myself to be able to predict\nthe future. Yet this is what most people get from the newspaper. They claim that they have a window into the future\nactions of other humans because they can read the market is going to collapse or that green is the new fashionable color\nfor this season.\n\n%p People would be a lot better off, on a whole, if people stopped deluding themselves that they are made smarter by the\nwords in the newspaper. Being in the know about current events, or activities does not make you more able to predict\nwide trends. Instead, it does the opposite: since you think that you have better knowledge of the world you predict on\nan even grander scale.\n\n%p This is crazy. I have a hard enough time predicting what I'll be doing tomorrow, and I have a lot of control over my\nown actions and behaviors. How can I possible predict what other humans are going to do tomorrow, or next week, or next\nyear. The person who claims he can do this is deluding themselves with the help of the newspaper and other pseudoscience\ninformation sources.\n\n%p If you see any merit in what I say, you should try a 30 day trial where you don't read the newspaper. It truly is a\ndifferent perspective to only look up the news that you actually care about, and to do it on your own time.\n\n%p Some people have told me that recently the financial markets have not been doing well. Some might argue that this is\ncrucial information to know, but I don't see how it is directly applicable to my life. What is directly applicable is\nhow I can learn how to change myself. How I can learn how to think better and change my behaviors to reflect better\nthoughts. That's what I care about and that's what I'm trying to pursue.\n\n%p For more information about predicting the future, I recommend all of the works of Nassim Nicholas Taleb.\n" }

,{ "url": "profitable-education\/", "title": "profitable education", "text": "profitable education%p I came up with an idea for a \"for profit\" education system when I was arguing with a friend about\nwhere a libertarian view of the world would take us in 100 years. I'm not sure if this idea is a great idea, but I think\nit's an idea that you really have to try out to see if it will work. No amount of speculation or thought experiments\nwill tell you the results of this. Even if education \"experts\" were to swear back and forth to me that this is the\ndumbest idea ever I'd still want to try it when I have the excess capital to do so. So here it goes:\n\n%p At age 5-7, parents, or students themselves (in the case of an orphan) apply to go to my school. I would select from\nthe applicants who to let into the school. These school would operate like a boarding school: students would be fed\nmeals, given housing, clothing, affection, and any other essentials necessary for survival. Neither the parents or the\nstudents would pay anything for the teaching or feeding or housing up front. Students would be taught through whatever\nmethod I and the teachers I hired found to be most efficient at the time. The reason we are motivated to teach the kids\nthe best way possible is because of the strong incentives for creating very productive citizens.\n\n%p Using the best knowledge I have of education so far, I would want to use an un-schooling technique for teaching these\nchildren. I would strongly facilitate and cultivate whatever activities they had interest in pursuing. The main reason I\nbelieve this technique will work is because people would pursue activities that they are passionate about. In the\ncurrent modern school setting, this passion cultivation is minimal. Most courses are highly specified and do not cater\nto individual tastes. I believe that my program would create people who are passionate about their chosen interest\/field\nand willing to work hard to further their knowledge in that field and its supporting activities.\n\n%p In exchange for this housing, feeding, loving, and educating, I will ask that former students return a percentage of\ntheir gross revenue to school. These revenues would allow the school to continue operating for more students, and help\nreturn the investment made on that student. Profits made through this process would be the profits of the education\ncompany and its shareholders.\n\n%p The legality of this contract is one of the largest up front issues I see. Students under the age of 18 (minors)\ncannot make a legal contract with a school that says they will pay a portion of their gross income to the school. This\ncommon law would make it difficult to have legal recourse against students who took the benefits of the school but they\nchose not to return their fair share. I think that if argued it a court it might be possible to win a case around this\nissue, and I also believe that students will, for the most part, honor their bargain as long as the school was nice to\nthem and taught them properly. This would be sure to make the schools be held more accountable to their treatment of the\nstudents, because if the students find out that they were treated poorly, or not taught in an acceptable way, then they\nwould simply stop honoring their end of the deal.\n\n%p What do you think about this system? What other issues does it have?\n" }
,{ "url": "no-shoes-for-6-months\/", "title": "no shoes for 6 months", "text": "no shoes for 6 months=image_tag \"five-fingers.jpg\" %p Last August, my friend Alan sent me an article about going\nbarefoot. It talks about how hard-soled shoes make you walk in a way that forces you to put your heel on the ground\nbefore the ball of your foot (cow-stepping). If you take of your shoes and walk naturally you will realize that you stop\nwalking this way. You start walking in a way called fox-stepping, where you put the ball of your foot down firs then\nslowly roll down your foot to your heel then apply the weigh of your body. This method of walking puts less stress on\nyour joints as you walk. %p When you put your heel on the ground first you are putting all of the weight of your body on\nyour leg bones which are completely straight. Anyone who has ever ridden a bike knows that if your seat is too high, and\nyour legs become fully extended it is hard to pedal and bad for your joints. This is because your body is not built to\nbe under stress at full extension. Your joints are made for bending, not for holding a rigid shape as if there was no\njoint at all. %p When you fox-step you avoid this stress. Instead of transferring all your weight to your foot while\nyour knee joint is fully locked, you transfer the weight when your joints are bent. As an added bonus, when you fox-step\nyou look more sure of yourself. Your body takes on a more natural posture, and that posture looks quite a bit more\nconfident. %p To start, I tried walking around my block barefoot on asphalt and concrete. I quickly learned that the\nsurfaces that humans have designed for themselves to walk on are actually terrible for human foot traffic. The rigidness\nof a concrete sidewalk is not a good walking surface for bare footers. I then tried walking in the grass next to the\nsidewalk and found joy. I loved walking barefoot on the ground where I could feel the different textures. After trying\nthe grass I went out into the street to see what that would feel like. The asphalt of the street had a great texture for\nwalking barefoot on. So right off the bat I liked walking barefoot more than with shoes on 2 out of 3 surfaces. Over\ntime I came to dislike walking barefoot on only 3 types of surfaces, and loved walking on all of the rest.\n\n%p The three surfaces I did not like walking on are concrete sidewalks, hot asphalt, and grocery store like tiled\nfloors. Besides these surfaces, it has been a joy to walk barefoot.\n\n%p To start my barefoot trial, I decided to spend the 7 day vacation to Mauii, Hawaiii completely barefoot. I only put\non shoes once, and only for about 1 minute during the entire 7 days. During the time I experiencing lava rocks, hot\nasphalt, beaches, restaurants, wood, 5 mile muddy hiking trail, airports, airplanes, cars, etc. It was a good experience\nand by the end I was starting to get callouses on my feet. Learning a barefooting lifestyle under the artificial\nconstraint of not wearing shoes for an entire vacation was a great way to introduce it to my feet and mind.\n\n%p I decided to continue to go barefoot when I came down to Champaign-Urbana for school. The number one question I got\nfrom inquisitive young minds is \"What are you going to do when it gets cold?\" A question to which I had no answer.\n\n%p But as it got cold, answers came. While I was siting on my porch my friend's (David Grayson) dad came by and told me\nabout some interesting barefoot running stories he had read. %p \n\n%ol %li Why shoes are bad for us (pdf) %li Men who run forever (pdf)\n\n%p These stories lead me to Vibram's new five-toed shoes. Which are quite good at protecting your feet in dry and chilly\nweather. Also, they fix most of the problems of traditional shoes because they\n\n%ul %li Have a completely flat sole %li Fit your feet like a glove %li Allow your toes to downwards as easily as upwards\n%p This last point is probably the most important for fox-stepping. Traditionally when people test the flexibility of\nshoes they only test how much the toe portion of the shoe bends up. This is not good for fox-stepping because the main\nmechanism of walking is to first put your toes and balls down on the ground first, which is most easily done when the\ntoes have a lot of downward flexibility. %p So next time your are testing the flexibility of shoes make sure the toes\ncan go down below the line of the sole.\n\n%p These shoes were great for a time, but as it started to get wetter and colder I realized that I needed something\nelse. The reason for this is the Vibram Five-Fingers are not waterproof and they are definitely not well insulated. This\ncombination made it hard to wear socks to keep warm, because if it got wet then the socks just made it worse anyway.\n\n%p This doesn't mean I don't recommend the shoes, they are great for running in and I will definitely wear them when it\ngets warm and dry again. But in the winter I needed something dryer and warmer.\n\n=image_tag \"720_chocolate_moose.jpg\"\n\n%p That's where Minnetonka's Double Bottom Mooseskin came along. If properly waterproofed it can stand up to the cold\nand water reasonably well, even in below freezing temperatures. I've been wearing these shoes for the last couple of\nmonths with no problems.\n\n%p People are asking me what I'm going to do when it gets warm. The answer of course is go barefoot again! It's great\nfun. Later I will probably write a post about the people who have been negative about my bare-footing experience, and\nhow I learned about people's health department misconceptions.\n" }
,{ "url": "inform-yourself-about-nuclear-waste\/", "title": "inform yourself about nuclear waste", "text": "inform yourself about nuclear waste%p The most common argument of Nuclear Power detractors is the production of large\nquantities of radioactive waste. I'm going to take a look at nuclear waste generation so that you can get a better feel\nfor the issue.\n\n%p Yesterday I received\n\n=image_tag \"ameren.png\"\n\n%p This made me want to calculate the upper bound of my household's Nuclear Waste production. The reason I say 'upper\nbound' is because the values for nuclear waste generation are just given as an upper bound on how much waste per 1000\nkilowatt-hours produced. The actual nuclear waste generation might be lower than this.\n\n%p You might also notice that there are two types of nuclear waste. High-Level Nuclear Waste is what I would call the\ntypical nuclear waste. It is the spent fuel, control rods and all other materials used directly in the fission reaction.\nHigh-Level Nuclear Waste accounts for 99% of the radioactivity of all nuclear waste[1]. The other type is called\nLow-Level Nuclear Waste. Low-Level nuclear waste is mostly things like radioactive protection suits and other things\nthat are indirectly exposed to the radiation of a fission reaction. These materials account for only 5% of the radiation\nand are thus much easier to handle and transport safely.\n\n%p Now back to the calculation. I looked at all my power bills from 2007 and totaled my kWh usage. In 2007, my house\nused 8208 kWh of electricity. Of that power, 7% of it was generated by Nuclear Power according to Ameren. So I take the\ntotal 1000 kWh (8.21) and multiply it by the total produced from known sources .0001 in the cases of both high and low.\nI get .000821 lbs of High Level Nuclear Waste and .000821 ft^3 of Low Level Nuclear Waste. One caveat on these numbers,\nas Ameren points out in their footnote, is that they didn't know the waste produced by 13% of their power because they\nbought it from other power companies. I neglect this mainly because I'm using .0001 as my figure for Nuclear Waste, even\nthough the actual numbers may be lower.\n\n%p Next, I decided to see what would happen if all of my power was generated by Nuclear. So I take .0001 and multiply\nby 100\/7 to convert the waste numbers to 100% of the waste. I think this is pretty valid because the only other wastes\nfrom nuclear power operation seem to be water vapor and waste heat, which most people argue are not pollution. This\ngives me <.0014 lbs and <.0014 ft^3 for High and Low wastes respectively. Multiplying this out I get: .011726 lbs and\n.011726 ft^3 respectively again.\n\n%p Since I found it hard to wrap my head around such small numbers, I decided to look at the entire state of Illinois,\nmy home state. For this calculation, I assume my power consumption is representative of all of the people of Illinois of\nwhich there are about 12,831,970 at the time of writing. This gives us 75.23 tons of High Level Nuclear Waste per year,\nand 5573 cubic yards of Low Level Nuclear Waste per year. This is if all of our power was produced by Nuclear Power.\n\n%p So 75.23 tons for Illinois sounds like a pretty big problem but let's look at a minimum of the amount of Carbon\nDioxide emissions this would remove. Ameren claims that it emits 1574 lbs of CO2 per 1000 kWh so that gives me the total\noutput of CO2 at current power consumption levels and distribution is 82,890,625 tons per year. By going to a full\nnuclear power generation model, we could be reducing the carbon footprint of Illinois by 82 Million tons!! So when\ndeciding between Nuclear Power and other options we must weigh in our head the relative advantages of both. If you think\nthat reducing the C02, Nitrogen Oxides, and Sulfer Dioxide in the air will help improve air quality and reduce the risk\nof global climate change, then you have to weigh this against the negatives of having Nuclear Waste around.\n\n%p Some people think that this great reduction isn't worth the risk of Nuclear Waste. I do not. I think that humans,\nwhen given the chance to solve a problem will be able to come up with a workable solution to dealing with Nuclear Waste.\n%p [1] N. Tsoulfanidis and R.G. Cochran, “Radioactive Waste Management,” Nuclear Technology, 93 (1991), pp. 263–304.\n" }

I offered the suggestion of using a\nnon-mud-host specific hosting provider to run a mud, like I do on Deimos MUD. (quarkmud.com 6666) Here is a tutorial for\ndoing it yourself.\n\nObtain an account on bluehost. (www.bluehost.com)\n\nClick sign up now. Enter domain name: www.yourMUD.com\/org whatever you want. I personally recommend you add domain\nprivacy with Bluehost. Enter all of your information about select that you are going to pay for 24 months right away.\n\nnow you are thinking: woah why is he saying to go for 2 years right away, right? Here's why: It only costs $166.80 for 2\nyears! Plus Bluehost has a great money back guarantee if you don't like their service. So if you 1 year from now you\ndecide that your MUD isn't going to exist anymore you just ask for a refund. Also, they throw in the free domain name,\nwhich is valued at $10 so that's great as well.\n\nNow comes the slightly hard part. You have to get shell access. This involves proving you are a citizen of the USA. If\nyou aren't citizen of the USA, sorry. To do this you need to email them a copy of your drivers license or passport. The\ninfo on it should match up with the info you entered above. I'm not exactly sure where to email this to, so just call\nBluehost (The number is on their website frontpage) and ask them what to do. They are fairly helpful.\n\nOkay now you have shell access. This tutorial isn't really how to set up a new MUD but more to move your MUD to\nBluehost. I might do a later tutorial about how to set up a new MUD if people are really interested.\n\nPresumably you have the files of your other mud somewhere on another shell. If this is the case do:\n\n$ scp your-user@otherhost.com:~\/path\/to\/mud\/ your-user@yourMUD.com:~\/mud\/\n\nThat could take a while to finish because your MUD probably has a crapload files. If your MUD has a MySQL database\ninstead, you'll still be okay. You just dump your database on your host and then upload it into the MySQL database on\nBluehost (which you can create really easily with the Bluehost cPanel)\n\nThere are many other ways to get the files onto the server and I can't cover them all, but some include FTP, RSync, and\nSubversion.\n\nOkay now that this is done you need to compile your MUD on Bluehost. This could be more difficult than your previous MUD\nhost. For instance, my circleMUD would compile fine on the old gcc that Wolfpaw was using, but Bluehost has a much newer\nGCC so I got a whole bunch of warnings and errors. The best way to fix these is to just go error by error, then warning\nby warning, until they are all fixed. After I fixed them all my MUD compiled okay. And I was able to run it. After it\nwas running I could connect to it with:\n\n$ telnet quarkmud.com 6666\n\nyou'd just substitute your domain name and port there.\n\nOne last thing you should know is that sometimes Bluehost kills processes that have been running for a really long time.\nIf this happens you want your MUD to come back up in a reasonable time. You cannot solve this the traditional MUD way of\njust having an autorun script that is constantly running. Instead you have to use a cron job. You can make the cron job\nusing the cPanel interface again. It is best to make a script that will be run to check if your MUD is still running.\nHere is my script for doing so:\n\n#~\/persistent_processes.sh\n\n#DeimosMUD\nDM=`ps ex | grep circle`\nif [ -z \"$DM\" ]; then\n  echo \"Restarting DeimosMUD\"\n  cd \/home\/your-user-name\/mud\/\n  .\/bin\/circle 6666 &\nfi\n\nMake sure the file is executable with:\n\n$ chmod +x persistent_processes.sh\n\nThis checks if there is a process running that contains the word 'circle.' If there is not, it restarts the server using\nthe proper shell command to restart the server. I set this script to run every minute using the cron task. To do this go\nto \"Cron Jobs\" on the cPanel and then select \"Advanced Unix Style.\" Then fill all of the boxes on the left in with\nasterisks and type the path to the file you saved above. The path should be something like\n\"\/home\/your-user\/persistent_processes.sh\". There you have it, now you have a stable MUD running for a good price.\n\nPerformance Note:\n\nMy performance on Bluehost has been better than Wolfpaw. Players all reported the speed increase which was quite nice to\nexperience especially for less money.\n" }

In the future, there will be no files. Why? Because files are an arbitrary construction that is an\nartifact of computers. Here's a small list of the problems with files:\n\n1.  You have to keep track of where they are.\n2.  You have to worry about backing them up and storing them.\n3.  You have to make sure they are in the right place.\n\nAll of these reasons serve to create a great barrier to people when they are dealing with computers. Only people who\nunderstand files can be any good at using a computer. This is a shame because it creates an arbitrary barrier to entry\nfor computers that doesn't need to be there are at all.\n\nSo far people have been focusing on number 2. There are lots of home backup products on the market, and even more\nwebsites are starting to get into the business of backing up your files. When a website backups of your files they are\nalso starting to take care of 1. implicitly.\n\nEventually someone is going to take care of all of these things on one platform, and people will never care about files\nagain. Here is my list of use cases that will tell me that files are dead.\n\n  - People never burn CD's because they don't care where their music is. (Hint: it's everywhere)\n  - I can look at an old version of something I was working on without hassle ever.\n  - I can mix two data sources together to form new mixed content.

Skirmishes are broken up into Battles, and are won by\nbest of 5. You must win by 2 battles to win the skirmish.\n\nOne player is the one ball, one player is the 9 ball.\n\nBalls are setup with one in each opposite cornor pocket, and the 8 ball(or Target) in the very center of the table.\n\nGame Play starts with the referee(or impartial observer in amateur games) saying \"Ready... Set... Go...\". The players\nthen shoot for the 8 ball.\n\nThe object of the game is to pocket the Target by having your ball be the last to touch the Target before it goes into a\npocket and stays in the pocket.\n\nTo clarify; The owner of the last moving Player Ball to touch the Target before it enters the pocket is declared the\nvictor of the Battle.\n\nThe referee must keep track of which moving ball last touched the Target.\n\nA player may only hit his or her ball when it is stationary.\n\nPlayers move around the table to gain better position to hit their ball, but they must give way to a person who's ball\nis moving slower than their own.\n\n\"Head Shot\": When a player pockets the Target and the Opposing Player Ball with the same shot, they recieve 2 battle\npoints, If this is enough to win the skirmish they win.\n\nPenalties\n\n  - All penalties are awarded by the referee(s). They must say the name of the penalty followed by the offender's last\n    name. In regulation play there are 3 referees one to watch the Target and one for each Player.\n  - \"False Start\": If one player strikes their ball before the referee says go, the opposing player wins the battle.\n  - \"Scratch\": If a player pockets their Player Ball, the game is paused and they must place it at the corresponding\n    locations, such that if it is pocketed in a side pocket the ball is placed in the very center, if it is pocketed in\n    a corner pocket it is placed in the center of that end of the table and the opposing player gets a free shot.\n  - \"Rolling Scratch\": If a player hits their ball before it has stopped rolling, play stops, and the opposing player\n    gets a free shot.\n  - \"Failure to Yield\": If you do not yield to the other player based on the above rules, play stops and the opponent\n    gets a free shot.\n" }
