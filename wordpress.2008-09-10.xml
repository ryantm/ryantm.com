<wp:comment_content>One nice thing is just how simple the means of supporting that is. You just evaluate things outermost-first. However, that alone would mean that sometimes expressions you passed to a function would get copied to more than one place in the body, requiring more steps to evaluate them over and over. To fix that, you just share results between the duplicate copies of each parameter, so that when one gets evaluated, each copy sees the changes. (Typically this is just done by making them all pointers to the same thing.)<br/><br/>That's all there is to lazy evaluation. Outermost-first with sharing.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here is a flow of how the press of America works from my current model of it.<br /><br />4:00 USA Today does interesting story<br />6:00 Radio talk shows pick up story and try to get people mentioned in the article on the air to talk about it the controversy of the story.<br />16:00 TV news stations try find local versions of interesting story by contacting the people mentioned in the story because they might have leads to the local version of the story.<br /><br />It's interesting to see how this works first hand. It seems that a lot of it is quite derivative, more than I had originally suspected. I guess this is a good thing though because it makes a person a lot less likely to 'miss' what is happening in the world, because all the different localities pick up the story and talk about it in their own context.<br /><br />Here is where the news is unfolding, (there is an audio clip of me talking in one of the comments),<br /><a href="http://davidegrayson.livejournal.com/17231.html">http://davidegrayson.livejournal.com/17231.html</a>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[That's right. In the future, there will be no files. Why? Because files are an arbitrary construction that is an artifact of computers. Here's a small list of the problems with files:<br /><ol><li>You have to keep track of where they are.</li><li>You have to worry about backing them up and storing them.</li><li>You have to make sure they are in the right place.</li></ol>All of these reasons serve to create a great barrier to people when they are dealing with computers. Only people who understand files can be any good at using a computer. This is a shame because it creates an arbitrary barrier to entry for computers that doesn't need to be there are at all.<br /><br />So far people have been focusing on number 2. There are lots of home backup products on the market, and even more websites are starting to get into the business of backing up your files. When a website backups of your files they are also starting to take care of 1. implicitly.<br /><br />Eventually someone is going to take care of all of these things on one platform, and people will never care about files again. Here is my list of use cases that will tell me that files are dead.<br /><ul><li>People never burn CD's because they don't care where their music is. (Hint: it's everywhere)</li><li>I can look at an old version of something I was working on without hassle ever.</li><li>I can mix two data sources together to form new mixed content. This doesn't just apply to music and videos. I can also mix text data with <a href="http://www.abridgegame.org/darcs/">patch grammar</a>, for instance.<br /></li><li>There is no downtime when switching to a new machine. I can get my stuff from anywhere, anytime.<br /></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today on Freenode#ruby-lang, I was talking to "Defiler" about <a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a>. It sounded great. I'm going to look into working on this open source project over the summer, because it seems worth it, and I could end up learning a whole heck of a lot.<br /><br />Evan, the founder of Rubinius, claims that it is 98% first class. I am interested to find out what that means, but I already know somethings it means. For instance, Methods are first class.<br />This works:<br /><pre><span class=ident>obj</span><span class=punct>.</span><span class=ident>methods</span><span class=punct>[</span><span class=symbol>:my_fibonacci</span><span class=punct>]</span> <span class=punct>=</span> <span class=ident>other_obj</span><span class=punct>.</span><span class=ident>methods</span><span class=punct>[</span><span class=symbol>:fibonacci</span><span class=punct>]</span></pre><br />Also, you can undo the effects of including a module very easily. Defiler says you just remove the module from the "ancestors" of the object and then the include is undone. That's a lot nicer than the messy code I'm going to have to write to undo a 1.8.5 ruby module include.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are looking for someone to vote for in 2008 you should consider Ron Paul. He has many of the core libertarian platform beliefs and he's not afraid to say that other candidates are full of crap. Which he so eloquently exposes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Going along the lines of my last post there is a new rubygem that is focusing on building a framework for static webpages using haml and sass as it's backbone. It's called <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/staticmatic/">StaticMatic</a> and it's a gem so...<br /><br /><pre>sudo gem install staticmatic</pre><br /><br />Then after you get it installed you need to do<br /><br /><pre>staticmatic setup my_app_name<br />staticmatic build my_app_name</pre><br /><br />This will give you a directory structure of my_app_name -> site, src. The site dir contains your site built from the source. So every time you do staticmatic build my_app_name you will be building your site/ dir from your src/ dir. This could use the improvement of a Rakefile to make the directory not matter, so I think I'll be attempting to add my Rakefile into the project.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday I started reading Duct Tape Marketing by John Jantsch. This book is seriously great! As the owner of a small business, I keep getting ideas in my mind about how to improve it's marketing while reading it.<br /><br />I've never actually read a Marketing book before. I've always focused on reading programming and entrepreneurial books before. I've realized though that if I want to get serious about supporting myself through my own businesses I have to learn how to market, because as Jantsch says, "every business is actually a marketing business." (pg xi) <br /><br />My plan as I know it so far:<br /><br />If I want to eat food, I need to convince other people to give me money. People only exchange money for value, so I need to show them how my business is valuable to them. If I just make something that is valuable, it's not good enough, because noone will know that I've made it and they will think whatever I've made is generic crap. That's why I need to market what I've made. To show people what I make is good stuff and they can get my good stuff by giving me money.<br /><br />Then I can go buy a bagel.<br /><br />Takeaways:<br /><br />You cannot survive on your technical skill alone!<br />People will not find you unless you market yourself.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently someone posted on The MUD Connector about having problems with their host. I offered the suggestion of using a non-mud-host specific hosting provider to run a mud, like I do on Deimos MUD. (quarkmud.com 6666) Here is a tutorial for doing it yourself.<br /><br />Obtain an account on bluehost. (www.bluehost.com)<br /><br />Click sign up now. Enter domain name: www.yourMUD.com/org whatever you want. I personally recommend you add domain privacy with Bluehost.<br /><br />Enter all of your information about select that you are going to pay for 24 months right away.<br /><br />now you are thinking: woah why is he saying to go for 2 years right away, right? Here's why: It only costs $166.80 for 2 years! Plus Bluehost has a great money back guarantee if you don't like their service. So if you 1 year from now you decide that your MUD isn't going to exist anymore you just ask for a refund. Also, they throw in the free domain name, which is valued at $10 so that's great as well.<br /><br />Now comes the slightly hard part. You have to get shell access. This involves proving you are a citizen of the USA. If you aren't citizen of the USA, sorry. To do this you need to email them a copy of your drivers license or passport. The info on it should match up with the info you entered above. I'm not exactly sure where to email this to, so just call Bluehost (The number is on their website frontpage) and ask them what to do. They are fairly helpful.<br /><br />Okay now you have shell access. This tutorial isn't really how to set up a new MUD but more to move your MUD to Bluehost. I might do a later tutorial about how to set up a new MUD if people are really interested.<br /><br />Presumably you have the files of your other mud somewhere on another shell. If this is the case do:<br /><pre><br />scp your-user@otherhost.com:~/path/to/mud/ your-user@yourMUD.com:~/mud/<br /></pre><br />That could take a while to finish because your MUD probably has a crapload files. If your MUD has a MySQL database instead, you'll still be okay. You just dump your database on your host and then upload it into the MySQL database on Bluehost (which you can create really easily with the Bluehost cPanel)<br /><br />There are many other ways to get the files onto the server and I can't cover them all, but some include FTP, RSync, and Subversion.<br /><br />Okay now that this is done you need to compile your MUD on Bluehost. This could be more difficult than your previous MUD host. For instance, my circleMUD would compile fine on the old gcc that Wolfpaw was using, but Bluehost has a much newer GCC so I got a whole bunch of warnings and errors. The best way to fix these is to just go error by error, then warning by warning, until they are all fixed. After I fixed them all my MUD compiled okay. And I was able to run it. After it was running I could connect to it with:<br /><pre><br />telnet quarkmud.com 6666<br /></pre><br />you'd just substitute your domain name and port there.<br /><br />One last thing you should know is that sometimes Bluehost kills processes that have been running for a really long time. If this happens you want your MUD to come back up in a reasonable time. You cannot solve this the traditional MUD way of just having an autorun script that is constantly running. Instead you have to use a cron job. You can make the cron job using the cPanel interface again. It is best to make a script that will be run to check if your MUD is still running. Here is my script for doing so:<br /><br /><pre><br />#<br />#~/persistent_processes.sh<br /><br />#DeimosMUD<br />DM=`ps ex | grep circle`<br />if [ -z "$DM" ]; then<br />  echo "Restarting DeimosMUD"<br />  cd /home/your-user-name/mud/<br />  ./bin/circle 6666 &<br />fi<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />Make sure the file is executable with:<br /><pre><br />chmod +x persistent_processes.sh<br /></pre><br /><br />This checks if there is a process running that contains the word 'circle.' If there is not, it restarts the server using the proper shell command to restart the server. I set this script to run every minute using the cron task. To do this go to "Cron Jobs" on the cPanel and then select "Advanced Unix Style." Then fill all of the boxes on the left in with asterisks and type the path to the file you saved above. The path should be something like "/home/your-user/persistent_processes.sh". <br /><br />There you have it, now you have a stable MUD running for a good price.<br /><br />Performance Note:<br /><br />My performance on Bluehost has been better than Wolfpaw. Players all reported the speed increase which was quite nice to experience especially for less money.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>There are quite a few limits that Bluehost imposes. Like you can only have a certain number of processes running on your account (20) and you can only use a certain amount of bandwidth. Also, your process can get killed if you use too many processes for too long. In practice though, these restrictions have no effected me directly, except for the 20 processes one. I have since changed the way I spawn processes and this restriction hasn't been a problem at all.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>The bandwidth restrictions are listed https://www.bluehost.com/tell_me_more.html . I don't think they talk about process number restrictions anywhere. I had to call them up to learn about that one. Restrictions on CPU/Memory are also not clearly listed anywhere, but I've never run into trouble with it. A quick search on bluehostforum.com does not show many people complaining about these problems.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>hmm. Sorry they weren't being nice to you. I think when I signed up I did not word things like "MUD" or "Game", I just said "persistent process." Also, I have read the Bluehost terms of service completely and they do not forbid MUDs or game servers.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I read <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/">"How to get up right away when your alarm goes off"</a> by Steve Pavlina on last Thursday Night. Ever since when my alarm goes off I've been jolting myself out of bed. I am working to build this habit. I did not follow his advice of practicing because I didn't feel that I needed it. I was correct.<br /><br />This new behavior has had some benefits already. I feel more productive in the early morning, and I also feel less tired. I am definitely going to practice this next semester at school. A lot of times last year I would sleep in and laze away the morning. This always ended up making me more tired.<br /><br />I'm also contemplating starting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">polyphasic sleep schedule.</a> It sounds like a lot of fun to try it because it changes your whole perspective on time. The main reason that Steve Pavlina stopped doing polyphasic sleep, after doing it for a year, was that he felt like he was spending less time with his wife. Even though he was with her the same amount of time, it felt like less, because she was only up for 2/3 of the time he was. I don't have this problem so maybe it will be easier to implement. If I form a relationship while on this schedule I will already have the expectation of how much time to spend with that person.<br /><br />Some ideas I have to combat loneliness are to start a IRC chatroom for polyphasic sleepers, and to start a group that talks about problems they face, and how we can attempt to convert more people to the schedule. I wouldn't try to do this until after I had adopted that sleep schedule though.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>I read a lot of Pavlina's articles, they're awesome.  I started doing the same exercise, and found it to work really well.<br/><br/>Polyphasic seems a little too crazy for me though, at least right now.  Some of my weekends are unpredictable, and I've heard if you break just one of those sleep phases then it's like hitting a brick wall.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>This is one of the early things I discovered when I got the iPhone, and I'm not even sure why.  I think I was sort of challenging the underlying technology.  "Would this be smart/dumb enough to think I'm actually not even sliding it, but intend to go from Point A to Point B?"<br/><br/>I'm still not sure if this is a glitch or intentional function.  Either way, I find myself trying to perfect my skill so that I can quickly unlock.  I'm always turning my iPhone on and off (and by off I mean standby mode).</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I decided to start two don't break the chain habits today, 1 Feb 2008.<br /><ol><li>Write a blog post every day.</li><li>Do sit ups or push ups and stretching every day.</li></ol>I have been spending too much of my time reading and processing other people's writings and not enough time practicing thinking and writing down my thoughts. As such, I propose that I practice thinking and communicating by writing down what I'm thinking at least once a day. I don't think that every post I write will be good, or even polished, but I think that getting into the habit of writing will allow me to improve upon my communication skills. Keep in mind that Albert Einstein once said:<br /><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><span class="body"></span><span class="body">Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.</span><br /></blockquote>I need to get un-lazy and start thinking for myself and communicating my thoughts with others. Too many times have I thought something interesting, and kept it to myself. Hey, even if the ideas aren't that good at least they will be out in the open so others can think about them and revise them if they find any value in them.<br /><br /><span class="bodybold"> </span><br />The second habit is to get myself back in shape. I've been having some lower back pains from playing dodgeball recently. By doing sit ups, I will be strengthening my abdominal muscles which will help to strengthen their complementary lumbar muscles. Hopefully this will help alleviate my back pain.  Also, I want to be able to touch my toes! Currently, I can't touch my toes while keeping my legs straight. I would like to be a lot more flexible than I am now.<br /><br />Well, if you are reading this and you know my personally please try to help me keep up these habits. I put a calendar on the door to my room in my house, and it will have markings for each of the habits.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Inform yourself about Nuclear Waste</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The most common argument of Nuclear Power detractors is the production of large quantities of radioactive waste. I'm going to take a look at nuclear waste generation so that you can get a better feel for the issue.<br /><br />Yesterday I received <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.ameren.com/AboutUs/ADC_AmerenLinesAmerenIP_Jan2008.pdf">this document</a> in the mail with my power bill. The second page contained these charts:<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_kIdEgOAP3dM/R6R6uoQDkDI/AAAAAAAAAAM/AWy3hbovAnc/s1600-h/ameren.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_kIdEgOAP3dM/R6R6uoQDkDI/AAAAAAAAAAM/AWy3hbovAnc/s400/ameren.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5162386014370762802" border="0" /></a>This made me want to calculate the upper bound of my household's Nuclear Waste production. The reason I say 'upper bound' is because the values for nuclear waste generation are just given as an upper bound on how much waste per 1000 kilowatt-hours produced. The actual nuclear waste generation might be lower than this.<br /><br />You might also notice that there are two types of nuclear waste. <span style="font-weight: bold;">High-Level Nuclear Waste </span>is what I would call the typical nuclear waste. It is the spent fuel, control rods and all other materials used directly in the fission reaction. High-Level Nuclear Waste accounts for 99% of the radioactivity of all nuclear waste[1]. The other type is called Low-Level Nuclear Waste. Low-Level nuclear waste is mostly things like radioactive protection suits and other things that are indirectly exposed to the radiation of a fission reaction. These materials account for only 5% of the radiation and are thus much easier to handle and transport safely.<br /><br />Now back to the calculation. I looked at all my power bills from 2007 and totaled my kWh usage. In 2007, my house used  8208 kWh of electricity. Of that power, 7% of it was generated by Nuclear Power according to Ameren. So I take the total 1000 kWh (8.21) and multiply it by the total produced from known sources .0001 in the cases of both high and low. I get .000821 lbs of High Level Nuclear Waste and .000821 ft^3 of Low Level Nuclear Waste. One caveat on these numbers, as Ameren points out in their footnote, is that they didn't know the waste produced by 13% of their power because they bought it from other power companies. I neglect this mainly because I'm using .0001 as my figure for Nuclear Waste, even though the actual numbers may be lower.<br /><br />Next, I decided to see what would happen if all of my power was generated by Nuclear. So I take .0001 and multiply by 100/7 to convert the waste numbers to 100% of the waste. I think this is pretty valid because the only other wastes from nuclear power operation seem to be water vapor and waste heat, which most people argue are not pollution. This gives me <.0014 lbs and <.0014 ft^3 for High and Low wastes respectively. Multiplying this out I get: .011726 lbs and .011726 ft^3 respectively again.<br /><br />Since I found it hard to wrap my head around such small numbers, I decided to look at the entire state of Illinois, my home state. For this calculation, I assume my power consumption is representative of all of the people of Illinois of which there are about 12,831,970 at the time of writing. This gives us 75.23 tons of High Level Nuclear Waste per year, and 5573 cubic yards of Low Level Nuclear Waste per year. This is if all of our power was produced by Nuclear Power.<br /><br />So 75.23 tons for Illinois sounds like a pretty big problem but let's look at a minimum of the amount of Carbon Dioxide emissions this would remove. Ameren claims that it emits 1574 lbs of CO2 per 1000 kWh so that gives me the total output of CO2 at current power consumption levels and distribution is 82,890,625 tons per year. By going to a full nuclear power generation model, we could be reducing the carbon footprint of Illinois by 82 Million tons!! So when deciding between Nuclear Power and other options we must weigh in our head the relative advantages of both. If you think that reducing the C02, Nitrogen Oxides, and Sulfer Dioxide in the air will help improve air quality and reduce the risk of global climate change, then you have to weigh this against the negatives of having Nuclear Waste around.<br /><br />Some people think that this great reduction isn't worth the risk of Nuclear Waste. I do not. I think that humans, when given the chance to solve a problem will be able to come up with a workable solution to dealing with Nuclear Waste.<br /><br />[1] N. Tsoulfanidis    and R.G. Cochran, “Radioactive Waste Management,” <i>Nuclear Technology,</i>    93 (1991), pp. 263–304.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I came up with an idea for a "for profit" education system when I was arguing with a friend about where a libertarian view of the world would take us in 100 years. I'm not sure if this idea is a great idea, but I think it's an idea that you really have to try out to see if it will work. No amount of speculation or thought experiments will tell you the results of this. Even if education "experts" were to swear back and forth to me that this is the dumbest idea ever I'd still want to try it when I have the excess capital to do so. So here it goes:<br /><br />At age 5-7, parents, or students themselves (in the case of an orphan) apply to go to my school. I would select from the applicants who to let into the school. These school would operate like a boarding school: students would be fed meals, given housing, clothing, affection, and any other essentials necessary for survival. Neither the parents or the students would pay anything for the teaching or feeding or housing up front. Students would be taught through whatever method I and the teachers I hired found to be most efficient at the time. The reason we are motivated to teach the kids the best way possible is because of the strong incentives for creating very productive citizens. <br /><br />Using the best knowledge I have of education so far, I would want to use an un-schooling technique for teaching these children. I would strongly facilitate and cultivate whatever activities they had interest in pursuing. The main reason I believe this technique will work is because people would pursue activities that they are passionate about. In the current modern school setting, this passion cultivation is minimal. Most courses are highly specified and do not cater to individual tastes. I believe that my program would create people who are passionate about their chosen interest/field and willing to work hard to further their knowledge in that field and its supporting activities.<br /><br />In exchange for this housing, feeding, loving, and educating, I will ask that former students return a percentage of their gross revenue to school. These revenues would allow the school to continue operating for more students, and help return the investment made on that student. Profits made through this process would be the profits of the education company and its shareholders.<br /><br />The legality of this contract is one of the largest up front issues I see. Students under the age of 18  (minors) cannot make a legal contract with a school that says they will pay a portion of their gross income to the school. This common law would make it difficult to have legal recourse against students who took the benefits of the school but they chose not to return their fair share. I think that if argued it a court it might be possible to win a case around this issue, and I also believe that students will, for the most part, honor their bargain as long as the school was  nice to them and taught them properly. This would be sure to make the schools be held more accountable to their treatment of the students, because if the students find out that they were treated poorly, or not taught in an acceptable way, then they would simply stop honoring their end of the deal.<br /><br />What do you think about this system? What other issues does it have?]]></content:encoded>

It talks about how hard-soled shoes make you walk in a way that forces you to put your heel on the ground before the ball of your foot (cow-stepping). If you take of your shoes and walk naturally you will realize that you stop walking this way. You start walking in a way called fox-stepping, where you put the ball of your foot down firs then slowly roll down your foot to your heel then apply the weigh of your body. This method of walking puts less stress on your joints as you walk.<br /><br />When you put your heel on the ground first you are putting all of the weight of your body on your leg bones which are completely straight. Anyone who has ever ridden a bike knows that if your seat is too high, and your legs become fully extended it is hard to pedal and bad for your joints. This is because your body is not built to be under stress at full extension. Your joints are made for bending, not for holding a rigid shape as if there was no joint at all.<br /><br />When you fox-step you avoid this stress. Instead of transferring all your weight to your foot while your knee joint is fully locked, you transfer the weight when your joints are bent. As an added bonus, when you fox-step you look more sure of yourself. Your body takes on a more natural posture, and that posture looks quite a bit more confident.<br /><br />To start, I tried walking around my block barefoot on asphalt and concrete. I quickly learned that the surfaces that humans have designed for themselves to walk on are actually terrible for human foot traffic. The rigidness of a concrete sidewalk is not a good walking surface for bare footers.  I then tried walking in the grass next to the sidewalk and found joy. I loved walking barefoot on the ground where I could feel the different textures. After trying the grass I went out into the street to see what that would feel like. The asphalt of the street had a great texture for walking barefoot on. So right off the bat I liked walking barefoot more than with shoes on 2 out of 3 surfaces. Over time I came to dislike walking barefoot on only 3 types of surfaces, and loved walking on all of the rest.<br /><br />The three surfaces I did not like walking on are concrete sidewalks, hot asphalt, and grocery store like tiled floors. Besides these surfaces, it has been a joy to walk barefoot.<br /><br />To start my barefoot trial, I decided to spend the 7 day vacation to Mauii, Hawaiii completely barefoot. I only put on shoes once, and only for about 1 minute during the entire 7 days. During the time I experiencing lava rocks, hot asphalt, beaches, restaurants, wood, 5 mile muddy hiking trail, airports, airplanes, cars, etc. It was a good experience and by the end I was starting to get callouses on my feet. Learning a <a href="http://www.barefooters.org/">barefooting</a> lifestyle under the artificial constraint of not wearing shoes for an entire vacation was a great way to introduce it to my feet and mind.<br /><br />I decided to continue to go barefoot when I came down to Champaign-Urbana for school. The number one question I got from inquisitive young minds is "What are you going to do when it gets cold?" A question to which I had no answer.<br /><br />But as it got cold, answers came. While I was siting on my porch my friend's (<a href="http://graysonfamily.org/%7Edavid/">David Grayson</a>) dad came by and told me about some interesting barefoot running stories he had read.<a href="http://ryantm.com/why-shoes-are-bad-for-us.pdf"><br /><br /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_kIdEgOAP3dM/R6fGKIQDkEI/AAAAAAAAAAU/tIlQjOlYJXo/s1600-h/large.jpg"></a><ol><li><a href="http://ryantm.com/why-shoes-are-bad-for-us.pdf">Why shoes are bad for us (pdf)</a></li><li><a href="http://ryantm.com/men-who-run-forever.pdf">Men who run forever (pdf)</a></li></ol>These stories lead me to <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/products_classic.cfm">Vibram's new five-toed shoes</a>. Which are quite good at protecting your feet in dry and chilly weather. Also, they fix most of the problems of traditional shoes because they<ul><li>Have a completely flat sole</li><li>Fit your feet like a glove<br /></li><li>Allow your toes to downwards as easily as upwards</li></ul>This last point is probably the most important for fox-stepping. Traditionally when people test the flexibility of shoes they only test how much the toe portion of the shoe bends up. This is not good for fox-stepping because the main mechanism of walking is to first put your toes and balls down on the ground first, which is most easily done when the toes have a lot of downward flexibility.<br /><br />So next time your are testing the flexibility of shoes make sure the toes can go down below the line of the sole.<br /><br />These shoes were great for a time, but as it started to get wetter and colder I realized that I needed something else. The reason for this is the Vibram Five-Fingers are not waterproof and they are definitely not well insulated. This combination made it hard to wear socks to keep warm, because if it got wet then the socks just made it worse anyway.<br /><br />This doesn't mean I don't recommend the shoes, they are great for running in and I will definitely wear them when it gets warm and dry again. But in the winter I needed something dryer and warmer.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_kIdEgOAP3dM/R6fIWYQDkGI/AAAAAAAAAAk/LeIt_8rdjbA/s1600-h/720_chocolate_moose.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_kIdEgOAP3dM/R6fIWYQDkGI/AAAAAAAAAAk/LeIt_8rdjbA/s400/720_chocolate_moose.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5163315784596033634" border="0" /></a><br />That's where <a href="http://www.mtonka.com/ecommerce/product?product%5fid=39">Minnetonka's Double Bottom Mooseskin</a> came along. If properly waterproofed it can stand up to the cold and water reasonably well, even in below freezing temperatures. I've been wearing these shoes for the last couple of months with no problems.<br /><br />People are asking me what I'm going to do when it gets warm. The answer of course is go barefoot again! It's great fun. Later I will probably write a post about the people who have been negative about my bare-footing experience, and how I learned about people's health department misconceptions.]]></content:encoded>

If you don't have a list it's more of just a watching role. Compiling lists of a candidate proved difficult. We didn't start with good lists. It would have been much better if we had started with lists of all of the people who voted republican in the last presidential primary. That list would have been much shorter and allowed us to focus our attention and time a lot better.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:130%;">Fill Your Time</span><br />I did not have enough activities to participate in to completely fill my day with campaigning. I still don't know what I could have done during the middle of the day. I guess the best advice is to carefully plan ahead of time what to do if you end up with free time on election day.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Why I Stopped Reading the Newspaper</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been about 4 years since I stopped watching TV regularly, and about half a year since I stopped reading the Newspaper. My reasons for stopping are similar to my reasons for not drinking alcohol. I believe that you need a reason to exhibit an action and you don't need a reason to not exhibit an action. When someone asks me, "Why don't you drink." I say, "I need a reason to drink, not a reason to stay sober." I try to extend this thought process to many of my other habits.<br /><br />The idea is that you should examine the things that you've learned to do, your habits, and make sure you have reasons for doing so. I'm not suggesting you go through all of your habits at once. Doing so would be counter-productive because you can't possible think about all of your habits at once, there are too many! Instead, just look at ones that are taking up a lot of your time, and are higher level behaviors. What I mean is that you shouldn't examine why you use your left hand to write. You should examine why you go to work everyday, or why you wake up and read the newspaper every morning, or why when you come home from work you sit down and watch television.<br /><br />Let's do a thought experiment now. Say you want to examine newspaper reading. If you agree with what I've said above, you need to look for a reason to read it.<br /><br />Newspaper Attractors (ranked most useful to least useful):<br /><ul><li>Can converse easily with other newspaper readers</li><li>Tells you the sentiment of the masses</li><li>May contain a few useful ideas or trends</li><li>Might miss out on something<br /></li></ul>Newspaper Detractors (most painful to least painful):<br /><ul><li>False positive on idea or trend<br /></li><li>Takes time to read</li><li>Encourages emotional response rather than active thinking</li></ul>It's nice to be able to converse with people about current events because it gives you something novel and common to talk about. However with some thought, it is usually not hard to find something that is novel and common to talk about. Especially if you can make yourself genuinely interested in the activities of other people. If you are interested in their activities you instantly have a communal interest.<br /><br />The only reason to know the sentiment of the masses, or the trends is so that you can go against them. Following the trends will just put you in the same boat as other mindless people who read the newspaper. To do anything useful in life, you need to buck the trends, follow the unbeaten path. This reminds me of the phrase:<br /><blockquote>If you keep doing what you've always done, you'll keep getting what you've always gotten.</blockquote>Only when you change yourself and not follow the trends can you accomplish something that is actually newsworthy.<br /><br />Now look at the detractors, how much time do you have to spend reading the newspaper every day just to get a little nugget of truth from the steaming pile of crap and hype? People I know spend anywhere from 15 minutes to 30 minutes a day reading the newspaper. I'm sure other people read more. If you do this everyday it really starts to add up. Think about what would happen if you instead used that time to exercise or just sit and meditate about your life. You'd be engaged in activities that have direct applicability to your life and survival, instead of reading about some esoteric far off conception of other humans.<br /><br />Even with the time issue aside, you can get false positives from the newspaper. If I had a dollar for every time the Business section of the Chicago Tribune changed from Bull to Bear on the front page, I'd be a very rich man. What the newspaper tries to convince you are sure trends are actually just the feelings and emotions of other humans. Lots of experimental evidence has shown that humans can't predict much of anything useful about the future. This is doubly true when you are trying to predict what other humans will do. When you predict the future, the other humans are too, which creates a very chaotic environment that the so called liberal "sciences" have made little inroads on.<br /><br />I don't trust the journalist to make predictions about events just like I don't expect myself to be able to predict the future. Yet this is what most people get from the newspaper. They claim that they have a window into the future actions of other humans because they can read the market is going to collapse or that green is the new fashionable color for this season.<br /><br />People would be a lot better off, on a whole, if people stopped deluding themselves that they are made smarter by the words in the newspaper. Being in the know about current events, or activities does not make you more able to predict wide trends. Instead, it does the opposite: since you think that you have better knowledge of the world you predict on an even grander scale.<br /><br />This is crazy. I have a hard enough time predicting what I'll be doing tomorrow, and I have a lot of control over my own actions and behaviors. How can I possible predict what other humans are going to do tomorrow, or next week, or next year. The person who claims he can do this is deluding themselves with the help of the newspaper and other pseudoscience information sources.<br /><br />If you see any merit in what I say, you should try a <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/">30 day trial</a> where you don't read the newspaper. It truly is a different perspective to only look up the news that you actually care about, and to do it on your own time.<br /><br />Some people have told me that recently the financial markets have not been doing well. Some might argue that this is crucial information to know, but I don't see how it is directly applicable to my life. What is directly applicable is how I can learn how to change myself. How I can learn how to think better and change my behaviors to reflect better thoughts. That's what I care about and that's what I'm trying to pursue.<br /><br />For more information about predicting the future, I recommend all of the works of <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've ever used Facebook's photo application you might have wondered how they make the images go so fast. Since I wanted to have fast viewing of our snapshot galleries over at <a href="http://www.brawlsnapshots.com" title="Brawl Snapshots">Brawl Snapshots</a>, I set out to figure out how to do it.

The main component of a fast gallery is caching. By telling the browser to load images in hidden divs before they are actually displayed to the user, the browser cache is primed for the quick switch.

The way you request these images in the background is the meat of the problem and the solution depends on what you are trying to do. With Facebook, each gallery has a limited number of photos in it, so Facebook loads all of the imag URLs, comments, and other meta data when you look at the first photo in the gallery. In the case of <a href="http://www.brawlsnapshots.com" title="Brawl Snapshots">Brawl Snapshots</a> this approach wouldn't work because some of our galleries have over 4000 images in them. Loading and rendering the meta-data for 4000 images just to view one would be a little wasteful.

<a href="http://www.ryantm.com/images/fast-gallery-requests.png">
<img src="http://www.ryantm.com/images/fast-gallery-requests.png" alt="Firebug shows AJAX requests from visiting one image" height="61" width="522" /> Fig 1: Firebug shows AJAX requests from visiting one image</a>

So instead of loading all the data up front I opted to use some AJAX requests to populate my cache as needed. When you go to a image in the Brawl Snapshot Gallery, it first loads the image you are on then it uses AJAX to asynchronously load the next and previous image in the background. After those finish we load the next's next and previous's previous image as well (see figure 1). This gives our viewers a buffer of two really quick images, which gives us ample time to load some more for all but the quickest users.

Time to get into the code, most of our fast gallery implementation is available at <a href="http://www.brawlsnapshots.com/javascripts/fast.js" title="Fast Javascript Gallery">http://www.brawlsnapshots.com/javascripts/fast.js</a>. I will try to explain the essential components.
<h3>1. The Populator (populates the cache when needed)</h3>
<pre>window.onload = function() {
if (YAHOO.env.ua.ie || YAHOO.env.ua.gecko || YAHOO.env.ua.webkit)
setInterval(populate, 200);
}

function populate() {
  var items = $('items');
  if (needsNext() &amp;&amp; gettingMoreNext == false) {
    id = lastObject(items).id;
    gettingMoreNext = true;
    new Ajax.Request('/snapshots/'+id+'/next?'+queryString, {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:'get'});
  }

  if (needsPrevious() &amp;&amp; gettingMorePrevious == false) {
    id = firstObject(items).id
    gettingMorePrevious = true;
    new Ajax.Request('/snapshots/'+id+'/previous?'+queryString, {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:'get'});
  }
}</pre>
I set the populate function to run every 200 milliseconds with the setInterval() function. Inside the populate function we test if we need to get more, or if we are already getting more snapshot pages. If we aren't then we launch an AJAX request to get more. When the AJAX requests return the scripts inside them are automatically evaluated. The code on the server side looks like this:
<pre>def previous
  item_parial = render_to_string(:partial=&gt;"snapshots/show", :locals=&gt;{:snapshot=&gt;@snapshot}
  render :update do |page|
    page.insert_html :top, 'items', item_partial
    page &lt;&lt; "newStuff('previous');"
  end
end</pre>
What this does is push the new snapshot into the top of the #items div, and then notify our page that it worked by called newStuff. Previous pushes onto the top of the #items div, and Next pushes onto the bottom of the #items div. This orientation is important because it lets us navigate through the cache later.
<h3>The Navigator</h3>
If you've followed these rough steps and modified them for your needs, you should have a list of divs inside an #items div that are in gallery order. Now you want to navigate through them using Javascript. To do this we have to make use of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/history/" title="Yahoo! UI Library: Browser History Manager">Yahoo! UI Library: Browser History Manager</a> which will give you cross browser history and make the back button work. Without this library it is very hard to make the back button work on a Javascript navigated gallery. Luckily Yahoo lets you only include the parts of its libraries upon which Browser History Manager Depends:
<pre>  &lt;script src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.1/build/yahoo/yahoo.js"&gt;
  &lt;script src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.1/build/event/event.js"&gt;
  &lt;script src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.1/build/history/history.js"&gt;
  &lt;iframe id="yui-history-iframe"&gt;
  &lt;input id="yui-history-field" type="hidden" /&gt;</pre>
This code only needs to be included once for your gallery viewer, not for each item. Now let's look at the top of the fast.js file where we do some more history initializations
<pre>function stateChange(state) {
  if (ignoreOneChange) {
    ignoreOneChange = false;
    return;
  }
  var ar = state.split("/");
  var our_id = "";

  for(piece in ar)
    if (ar[piece].indexOf &amp;&amp; ar[piece].indexOf("?") != -1)
      our_id = ar[piece].split('?')[0];

  toElm = document.getElementById(our_id);
  if (toElm)
    itemTo(document.getElementById(our_id),false);
  else
    window.location = state
}

YAHOO.util.History.register("items", window.location.toString(), stateChange);
YAHOO.util.History.initialize("yui-history-field", "yui-history-iframe");

var bookmarkedState = YAHOO.util.History.getBookmarkedState('items');
if (bookmarkedState != null)
  window.location = bookmarkedState;</pre>
stateChange is a function that I register with the history manager to be called every time the browser's location changes. The purpose of stateChange is synchronize the state of the browser with the history, so this is why if the requested spot in history is in the current cache we immediately jump to that image, otherwise we have to tell that page to load with window.location. Then I make sure there is no current bookmarkedState. If someone were to bookmark an AJAX snapshot with ID 30 the URL might look something like: http://bs.com/snapshots/10#/snapshots/30 so you can see why you might want to revert this to http://bs.com/snapshots/30. You need to do this since web servers are not sent any part of the URL after the octothorpe(#) you would end up at snapshot 10 when you wanted to be at snapshot 30.

The last thing to cover is how to insert something into the history. Basically whenever we click a Next link we run some javascript. In this case we run nextItem(), which calls updateURL if it is successful.
<pre>function updateUrl() {
  var newState = "/snapshots/"+currentItem.id+"?"+queryString;
  if ($('yui-history-iframe'))
    $('yui-history-iframe').contentWindow.document.title = document.title;
  YAHOO.util.History.navigate("items", newState);
}</pre>
This tells the history manager to navigate to the new state. We also set the title of the iframe here so that the history in Internet Explorer contains the page titles. When the url is updated we need to make sure that the title of the page is updated as well. In order to do this I have an element inside each item div that contains the title it should be, and then I look it up to put as the document title when that snapshot is viewed.

Well that about sums up everything I learned about fast galleries. Hopefully this helps you make fast galleries on your own site.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Accounts is inadequate for my usage of Google's services. First, I have a google apps account for my email, I'd like this to be my primary account. Unfortunately there are certain Google applications that only work with a Google Account and Not a Google Apps for your Domain Account. These services include 4 that I know of: Google Reader, Google Adsense, Google Adwords, and Google Checkout. What is most disappointing to me is that Adsense and Adwords are supposed to be Google's flagship moneymaker products, the ones they should be caring most about. The only google application to be responsible about this is Google Analytics, it lets you add other email accounts to have access to the application, and because of this it works properly with my account setup.

In order to use these second class Google citizens, I have to log out of one Google account and into another. This leads to confusion between my tabs; ever left Google Reader open while checking your ad revenue, too bad, you can't!

Here's a special gripe about Google Reader. They have this nifty feature that lets you email your friends an item that you particularly like, but it just assumes that it will check your Gmail account contacts. If your login to Google Reader is ryan@ryantm.com and ryantm.com is hosted google app, then it should check your contacts over there. Instead I get a blank auto-completer even though my auto-completer works in my email account.

Anyway, Google, get your act together. You should have been able to figure out accounts better than this, instead you're doing accounts in the same crappy way as everyone else: total chaos]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[So Google App Engine(GAE) came out and it has generated quite a buzz in the blagosphere especially surrounding the idea of <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/09/Google-Users-API">sharecropping</a>. But that isn't want I want to talk about. I want to talk about the growing amount of evidence that strikes down the idea that programmers are smarter than the average person.

There is a certain mythos surrounding the idea that some of us can "talk to the machines," while others cannot. This misunderstanding has been capitalized by many programming types to act in a  condescending manner against the people who do not know about computers. This has led to the mistaken belief that programmers are smarter than the average person. This is not the case. Programmers are humans like everyone else who have chosen to study an area very deeply. Many other humans have chosen to study other areas deeply as well, for instance, have you ever met a sculptor, or a advertiser, or a politician? Every area where people are engaged they are studying things at a deeper level than average. This deeper level of study does not make them smarter, it just means they have more contextual information. Now that I've introduced this flawed belief of programmer intelligence, I'd like to offer some evidence that caused me to write this article.

When Google release their App Engine, they made a Google Code issue tracker for it. This tracker has since, at the suggestion of Google employees, become a dumping ground for feature requests for GAE. One feature, which I was particularly interested about--being a ruby programmer--, is Ruby support. Now Google Code ranks issues on the issue page by the number of people that have starred an issue and starring an issue lets you receive updates when the issue's status changes ( i.e. the feature is implemented). Unfortunately this also means you receive comments every time someone comments to the thread, and unfortunately as well, there are a lot of average Ruby programmers that showed up on this issue thread. The result is that since I have starred the issue, I've received over 300 emails from people who have written comments that say:
<blockquote>+1</blockquote>
Yep that's right, that's all it says. I've been receiving them at what seems like two a minute, though that's an exaggeration. People have tried to quell the mob of idiots by numerous posts telling people to stop, and that it only counts if you star it, but no one listens. They just keep posting "+1" by the hundreds. While these actions were surprising to me, they should not have been. People are going to keep following the crowd and writing plus one because they are people. Programmers aren't different or better. Programmers are still humans.

One last thing I'd like to say that is probably the reason programmers have thought so highly of themselves and in some cases acted condescendingly to non-programmers. I believe that computer programming is an essential skill, along the lines of literacy, and speaking. The reason I categorize it with these is because, just like writing, reading and speaking, programming is game changing. With computer programming people can take an idea and propagate it massively and automatically. Properly programming something can change the way every other human who interacts with that program behaves and lives. This is powerful stuff that shouldn't be relegated to one group of skilled persons.

Anyone with programming skills can work to automate their job of doing menial tasks. For example, when I worked at Caterpillar as an engineering intern, they had about 3 people who's primary job was to make charts and give presentations to management about these charts. The charts graphed the quality of the machines we were shipping and the manufacturing defects that were caught. I noticed that these 3 people were spending at least 3 hours a day using excel to generate these charts. So I created a Visual Basic program (the only programming language I had available to me) to generate these charts automatically in a fraction of the time. The reason I bring this up is not that I think these people should have been writing programs to do their graphs for them. I bring it up because what if they could? What if they could sit down and automate the task in front of them, and then move on to doing other useful activities for the company.

This behavior of automation of jobs at the lowest level is why I say programming changes the game like reading, writing and speaking. When people at the lowest level learned to read and write it changed the game. Literate people can communicate much more effectively with their peers and get their ideas across to a lot of people. This idea automation through literacy is paralleled by task automation through computer programming. Look at what this means, just as you can't have an elite group of scribes that does all your information dissemination, you can't have an elite group of programmers to do your job automation. The idea of a programmer as a skill or trade needs to be broken down before we can see the true gains in productivity that computers promise.

So I kinda jumped around a bit here, I first cut down programmers to average, then I said, "wouldn't it be great if the average person knew how to program." I guess those ideas a bit hypocritical but they both serve to explain why I think that programmers aren't as elite as they signal to others, and that others need to learn programming. I can hear it every time someone goes, "ooh I'm not good with computers."]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>i think you miss the point: the google ui sux the big one - it's totally non-obvious that the little star thingy is for voting, all they have is a silly 'title' attribute of you happen to hover on it.  they could at least have the normal 'five stars' or whatever.  in addition the ui makes non-obvious how to opt out of the bloody emails, which is really the issue: you'd be annoyed no matter what comments said, '+1' or otherwise, if you were getting 100/day.  it amazes me that programmers are so stupid they don't realize this and, instead of filing bug reports or complaining to google - bicker amongst themselves, voting '+1' on one side and yelling about it on the other.  go to the source: google.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Ara, I suppose that people who are able to type "+1" are able to read the posts, and this whole "+1" mess is not really necessary.

I don't know if there is a discussion going on on this topic, because I had to killfile the information I get from Issue 29, because it is a) an enormous amount, and b) the Signal/Noise ratio is horrible (approaching 1 for the Noise, when I take a look at the emails filtered out).

And the only way to opt out of receiving emails is un-starring Issue 29, somewhat defeating the purpose.

And while it is nice, Ara, that you point out the failings on Google's side, that doesn't really eliminate Ryan's point: That Programmers are no smarter than Joe Sixpack, Hicktown, Ohio.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>ara, imo you're missing the point about what point Ryan's missing ;)

"People are going to keep following the crowd and writing plus one because they are people."

How do you know that? Actually you can't. 

You're guessing, and what you guess, in this case tells more about yourself than it's "evidence" about programmers in general. No offense intended, but I think you're way of the mark with this.

What if people are +1'ing that thread just for fun? Because it breaks the rules? Or to intentionally raise attention by acting like a purple cow? 

Obviously this blog post is the best prove that all of these ... somehow ... would achieve their goal. 

But I'm just thinking out loud. Err, guessing ;)) Anyways. Personally I had a *lot* of fun today with my email inbox.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>+1 :). Can't you set up a mail filter to get rid of the +1's? As far as GMail goes you can.

Set the from field, has the words +1 and delete it. It would be real nice to mark it as spam so that the 300+ idiots who send out the mails all get marked as spambots ;).</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to remind yourself of an email? People frequently remind themselves of emails by leaving those emails in their inbox. If you're busy, like me, your inbox reminders will grow uncontrollably. That's why I developed <a href="http://www.replylater.com">ReplyLater.com</a>. ReplyLater.com lets you schedule email reminders by simply sending emails. Let me show you what I mean.

Say I want to send an email to a company about a business proposal I have. I want to make sure they reply to me within a certain timeframe, or I want to followup again. The way I used to do this is by sending the mail to myself and leaving it in my inbox until I have the time to look through my inbox for things to do. Instead now I just address the email like this:
<pre>
BusinessDevelopmentGuy@google.com, 2weeks@replylater.com</pre>
Good, I'm giving BusinessDevelopmentGuy 2 weeks to get back to me, but after that I'm going to get a email reminding me about this.

There are plenty of other applications to this as well. You can remind yourself about future events and obligations, like birthdays, anniversaries, little league games, vacations, etc.

<a href="http://www.replylater.com">ReplyLater.com</a> is free to use, so theres no reason you can't go to <a href="http://www.replylater.com">the website</a> and check it out and start using it now! Any comments or suggestions are appreciated.]]></content:encoded>

<title>HAML: why you should use it</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://nex-3.com/posts/76-haml-2-0">HAML 2.0</a> is out. I've been using HAML since back when I made my <a href="http://www.sassins.com">Assassins Game Hosting Service</a> in 2007. If you are still using ERB or some other templating language for your web applications here is why you should given HAML a try.

<strong>HAML gets rid of end tags.</strong> By using Python like indentation it removes the need for you to type all of those pesky HTML endtags. Also, it lets you quickly see the nesting of tabs simply by the indentation of the line you are on. This quick look at nesting is espcially helpful when your HTML files start to get longer than 80 lines or so.

<strong>HAML generates pretty source.</strong> I am anal about how my HTML souce looks. I want it to be indented with spaces at every nesting point. If you've ever seen the HTML source for a webpage generated in on of the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/">terrible</a>, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/frontpage/default.aspx">horrible</a> WYSIWYG editors, you know exactly what I don't want. Every time I look at the source of pages generated by those tools a little piece of me dies. HAML is the complete opposite of this. It generates the cleanest possible HTML document it can. The file format convinces you to write cleanly, but it also smooths over some errors you could make. For instance, if you include unnecessary newlines in your source file, HAML removes them, leaving on the effectful newlines.

<strong>HAML is integrated with Ruby. </strong>ERB's Ruby integration is a joke. All it does it execute Ruby between &lt;% %&gt; with a little extra handling for loops and if statements. HAML's Ruby integration is like a Red Corvette. You can use = for ruby code with output, or == for ruby strings, or - for Ruby code without output. Also, now with HAML 2.0 error handling for Ruby and HAML is great a well.

<strong>HAML installation is easy.</strong> You can try HAML out right away with little effort, and no conflict with your current Rails installs just do the following:
<pre>gem install haml --no-ri</pre>
<pre>haml --rails path/to/app</pre>
I should also mention that HAML is used in my favorite <a href="http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org">static HTML generator</a>, Staticmatic.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Delegating Your OpenID Authentication doesn&#8217;t work with Drupal 6</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I read that <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0" title="Drupal 6">Drupal 6</a> supported OpenID, I was happy about it. I use OpenID for logins whenever I can, but I have it set up in a sort of novel way. My novel way is to have my open id be www.ryantm.com and then have that website <strong>delegate the authentication</strong> to another company. In my case, I picked this <a href="http://www.myopenid.com">good OpenID providor</a>. I figured out how to do this by watching <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2288395847791059857">Simon Willison's google video talk</a>. All you do is add these few lines to the head element of your OpenID url, but replace 'ryantm' with your username:
<pre id="line1"><span class="comment">&lt;!-- / Open Id --&gt;</span>
&lt;<span class="start-tag">link</span><span class="attribute-name"> href</span>=<span class="attribute-value">'http://www.myopenid.com/server' </span><span class="attribute-name">rel</span>=<span class="attribute-value">'openid.server' </span><span class="error"><span class="attribute-name">/</span></span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="start-tag">link</span><span class="attribute-name"> href</span>=<span class="attribute-value">'http://ryantm.myopenid.com' </span><span class="attribute-name">rel</span>=<span class="attribute-value">'openid.delegate' </span><span class="error"><span class="attribute-name">/</span></span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="start-tag">meta</span><span class="attribute-name"> content</span>=<span class="attribute-value">'http://www.myopenid.com/xrds?username=ryantm.myopenid.com' </span><span class="attribute-name">http-equiv</span>=<span class="attribute-value">'X-XRDS-Location' </span><span class="error"><span class="attribute-name">/</span></span>&gt;</pre>
The great part about this is that it works with <strong>any OpenID providor</strong>. So if at some point myopenid.com crosses my path, I can just delegate my OpenID authentication to another providor, and all of my OpenID logins will still work. In a sense, I've given myself complete flexibility with <strong>no chance of lock-in</strong>.

<img src="http://www.ryantm.com/blog/wp-content/noopenid.png" alt="No Open ID" width="771" align="middle" height="256" />

Unfortunately Drupal 6's OpenID support isn't up to snuff to handle my OpenID Delegation. It seems that while they seem claim they've implemented the entire OpenID spec by the wording on their marketing pages it doesn't work for me. I tried www.ryantm.com and http://www.ryantm.com and it keeps rudely telling me that's not a valid OpenID. I was under the impression that <strong>any url was a valid OpenID</strong>.

Anyway, I've created a <a href="http://drupal.org/node/264307">bug report</a> for this so you can follow what's going on. Please add comments to the bug if you are having this problem as well.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>Yup. Added my comment. Unhappy that drupal is still lacking on these issues...

Thanks for filing the bug report BTW.</wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hank Williams over at the Why Does Everything Suck blog is saying <a href="http://whydoeseverythingsuck.com/2008/05/yahoos-new-browserplus-game-changer.html">Yahoo Browser Plus is a Game Changer</a>, but I don't think so. While I agree that Yahoo Browser Plus is more well put together than Google Gears, both in terms of downloading and installing modules, and that their model for designing new modules is more open-source and organic, they need to <strong>get their software on computers</strong>.
<h2>Developers, Developers, Developers, Developers</h2>
Getting this <strong>Browser++</strong> software on computers has already been shown to be quite difficult. Until these add-ons get close to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html">market penetration of flash</a> they are going to have a particularly<strong> tough time attracting developers</strong>. I was also surprised that while Yahoo Browser Plus seems to be better than Google Gears in a lot of ways, they have <strong>no version targeting Ubuntu Linux</strong>, something that Google Gears has been serious about since the beginning. <em>If you want to attract good developers to your product, you need to run on Linux</em>.
<h2>Socket Applications Won't Suck as Much</h2>
A web application that I'm working on would particularly benefit from the widespread penentration of the Browser++ software. I'm making a browser based MUD client. Right now the only way to reasonably do this is to have a persistent socket server on the web server that is hooked up to the browser via AJAX. This works pretty well, but an version built similarly to Yahoo's IRC chat, would shuttle most of my server load to the users computers, where they have typically resided for socket based clients in the past. This seems like it would be a great candidate for a Browser++ application but there are a couple of hangups so far.
<h2>Future of Browser++</h2>
I am particularly hesitant to use Browser++ tools to develop my web applications, because <strong>the web is supposed to work everywhere</strong>. If the software doesn't have enough penetration it doesn't make sense to build a solution that you want to work everywhere on these tools. The unfortunate problem with this is that it is a chicken and egg problem. Macromedia solved this problem by integrating Flash over many many years. They didn't just release Flash and then say "okay now the game has changed, everyone can run streaming video on the web." This happened over time. <strong>The game hasn't changed, it is changing</strong>.]]></content:encoded>

<title>How to win at Scrabulous using Regular Expressions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.ryantm.com/images/Scrabble_board_in_play.jpg" alt="Scrabble" width="186" align="left" height="140" />This will tell you how to win at Scrabulous using a few simple Linux commands and a working knowledge of Regular Expressions. The basic principle behind this approach is to quickly write regular expressions to search for every possible word you can make a specific part of the board. By cating a scrabble word list into a pipe and using egrep with regular expressions, you can quickly and easily match patterns against your tiles and the state of the board.

Quick example:
<pre>$ wget http://www.ryantm.com/scrabble-word-list.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf scrabble-word-list.tar.gz
$ cat scrabble-word-list | egrep "^A[EPABVT]{4}$"
ABATE</pre>
We've found a valid 5 letter scrabble word that starts with an A (^ means start of line), contains 4 of the set E,P,A,B,V,T ($ means end of word). Expanding on this concept you can do all sorts of awesome patterns.

Say you want to make a word that goes from what you currently have to a triple word score 5 tiles away that connects to a D. You just do something like this:
<pre>
$ cat scrabble-word-list | egrep "^[EABTTE]*D$"
ABATED
BATTED
BETTED
TABBED
TATTED
TEATED</pre>
Then suddenly you've got a list of words that work for what you want. I did * here instead of {4} * means match as many characters as you can. It's usually a good idea to start with * and narrow it down with {number} if you need to.  You might notice that one of them doesn't work (TABBED), because you don't have two B's. The regular expression matcher doesn't care how many times you put a letter inside a set ([]) and it will match it as many times as it can. You can filter these words quickly yourself though, because you know you don't have two B's.
<h3>The General Principle</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Take what letters you have an form at set: [BZTQEAI]</li>
	<li>Find a starting or ending place: ^ACE or Y$</li>
	<li>Put it together with the number of letters you want to use: "^ACE[BZTQEAI]*"</li>
	<li>Double check the word with reality</li>
	<li>Repeat until you are satisfied with your word score.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Ruby Socket Persistence</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's surprisingly simple to persist your socket connections while restarting a Ruby program. The key lies in understand how Ruby handles file descriptors. A file descriptor is a number that represents an open file that is buffered in the OS Kernel. Now I've only tried this technique on Linux so I don't know if it works on Windows, so chime in on the comments if it does or does not work. Let's start by exploring file descriptors a little bit so we can improve our Linux knowledge. If you want immediate gratification you can skip down to the bottom-most snippet.

<code>
irb(main):001:0&gt; require 'socket'
=&gt; true
irb(main):002:0&gt; sock = TCPSocket.open("google.com",80)
=&gt; #&lt;TCPSocket:0xb7c73c44&gt;
irb(main):003:0&gt; sock.fileno
=&gt; 3
</code>

note that the file number of the socket is 3. Now look at the output of lsof:

<code>
ryan@rtmlap:~$ lsof -c irb
COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE    SIZE    NODE NAME

</code>

Alright, so now here's the snippet that shows persistent sockets:
<pre>#!/usr/bin/ruby
#simple_connector.rb
require 'socket'

puts "Started."

if ARGV[0] == "restart"
  sock = IO.open(ARGV[1].to_i)
  puts sock.read
  exit
else
  sock = TCPSocket.new('google.com', 80)
  sock.write("GET /\n")
end

Signal.trap("INT") do
  puts "Restarting..."
  exec("ruby simple_connector.rb restart #{sock.fileno}")
end

while true
  sleep 1
end</pre>
When the program is first run it prints 'Started.' Then it opens a socket to Google and requests the homepage. Then it waits indefinitely until it receives the INT signal (CTRL-C or kill -term PID). After that it runs exec which spawns a new program in the place of the current one. It spawns the same program, with additional command line arguments "restart #{fileno}." When the program starts again these additional arguments make it follow the other path, which uses IO.open(file_descriptor) to open the file descriptor from the file descriptor number that we passed in on the exec line. Then it reads the socket Kernel buffer, which already contains the Google homepage.

And there you have it, a socket that persists beyond a single program.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content>If my understanding of the socket model is correct, you might not have a fully-functioning socket the second time around. When the program exits, the socket goes into CLOSE_WAIT mode, and if there's any data waiting in the buffer, you can open the file descriptor again and retrieve that data. But I'm not positive that you'd be able to send or receive anything additional on that socket.

I didn't actually know that it was possible to reopen the socket. That's kinda cool, but I'm obligated to ask -- why are you trying to do this?</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>Jacob: Thanks for the point about CLOSE_WAIT I'll have to check out what state the socket is in. I did however test what would happen if I do the GET from Google after restarting, and that worked. I thought it was less impressive to show that snippet because the request and output aren't separated by a restart. I doing this so that when I restart the backend of MUDBrowser, none of my customer's connections are interrupted.</wp:comment_content>

<wp:comment_content>As far as the kernel is concerned, the socket isn't being closed or re-opened at all.  File descriptors which aren't marked close-on-exec remain open when you call exec() to overlay the existing process with a new program (man 2 execve).  The call to IO.open() simply associates a new Ruby object with the existing, still-open kernel-level file descriptor, much like fdopen(3) in the C stdio library.

Also note that if Ruby internally buffers reads from (or writes to) the socket, you may lose some data if you call exec() without flushing Ruby's buffers.</wp:comment_content>

<blockquote> If you remember, after 9/11 the government dropped the Patriot Act within about 20 days and it was passed. I mean, the Patriot Act is huge. I remember someone asking a Justice Department official, how did they write such a large statute so quickly, and of course the answer was that it’s been sitting in the drawers of the Justice Department for the last 20 years waiting for the event that would allow them to drop it.

Of course, the Patriot Act is filled with all sorts of insanity about changing the way civil rights are not protected anymore in the United States. So I was having dinner once and Richard Clarke was sitting at the table and I said to him, “Is an equivalent, is there a Patriot Act — an i-Patriot Act — just sitting waiting for some substantial event for them to come and have an excuse to radically change the way the internet works?”

And he said, “Of course there is.” And I swear this is what he said, and quote, “Vint Cerf is not going to like it very much.”

So this is the big terror. They’re just sitting there waiting for the inevitable to happen, and then ‘Slam!’</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>
