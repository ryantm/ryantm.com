      <title>Systematic Exploration</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
          Whether you are visiting a new place, or visiting a very familiar, systematic exploration can help you become familiar with your surroundings. Systematic exploration is the process of exploring every possible dimension of the place you are in. A simple example is that you go to the grocery store. Instead of visiting only the aisles that contain things of interest to you, visit every aisle in sequence. While you are doing this hold in your mind the intention that you will find something cool that you've never seen before. This works for new grocery stores and ones you have frequently used. One time, I was in Walmart and I decided to systematically explore the grocery section. Just from this decision I found some great textured vegetable protein hidden in the freezer section.
        </p>
        <p>
          This technique also works if you start a new job. When you start the job, visit every person's office, visit every workstation on the shop floor, look inside every tool chest. People might think you are nuts but in no time you will not have to interrupt people to find things for you and soon you might even be telling others where things are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Systematic exploration can help you learn more about where you live. Instead of just driving or walking from where you are to where you want to go, take different routes each time so you can explore where different shops and entertaining things are. Just last week I found an awesome view of east Las Vegas by systematically exploring some roads. I also stumbled upon a large yard that was completely filled with Christmas lights and people touring a chocolate factory. Now I know how to find a great view and a chocolate factory, which was totally worth the extra gasoline I had to use to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of us have a little extra time each week, extend your commute a little bit so that you can find something interesting. Consider exploring to be a fun date in itself. Instead of planning where to go say, "How about we go exploring?"

      <title>Capital Preservation</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
          One financial skill that I have been most interested in lately is <b>capital preservation</b>. Capital preservation means that once you decide to invest some money, you try to never spend that money on a non-investment related activity, or lose it on bad investment. Operating from this frame of mind does two things for you. One, it keeps you thinking about ways to invest your money, and two it forces you to save for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my life goals is to invest more and more of my net income over the course of my life. As a start out, it should be tough to save more than 50% of my current income, but as I start earning more money, living more efficiently, and making more money from investment opportunities, this percentage should get higher. There really is no limit to how high this percentage can be, for instance, if you are one of the richest people in the world, you have so much money that you can even possibly spend it all on yourself, so you have to invest it. One of the richest people in the world might have a capital preservation rate of 99.999%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Increasing your capital preservation rate is a good idea because the more capital you have, the more additional income you can generate from it. Take the simple example of a savings account. When your account earns interest, if you keep the interest in that account, that interest also earns interest. It is called compounding -- <b>one of the most important financial concepts</b>. The more capital you have that generates additional capital, the higher and more quickly your capital preservation rate will climb.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Most financially illiterate people actually try to do the exact opposite.</b> Instead of trying to increase their capital preservation rate, they try to decrease it. If you spend every dollar you make on non-investment activities, your capital preservation rate is 0%. It does not matter if you make $1 million dollars a year, or $10 dollars a year. If you spend it all, your capital preservation rate is 0%.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is actually possible to have a negative capital preservation rate. If you spend more than you make on non-investment activities you have a negative rate. It does not matter if you are spending money that was in a bank account, or money you got on credit ( credit card, loan, etc.). Either way you have a negative capital preservation rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most illiterate people actually try to maximize their negative capital preservation rate. They will try to borrow as much money as they can from banks, and credit cards for non-investment expenditures. While they think they are living like a rich person, really they are as far from it as possible. A truly rich person tries to maximize their capital preservation rate, the richest have a rate so close to 100% that they stop caring.

      <title>Opportunity Monitoring Company</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
          Often I think of ideas for companies that sound great. Upon further inspection, I find that there is some small economic detail that needs to be true before the idea can be a success. For example, my friend <a href='http://www.davidegrayson.com'>David Grayson</a> and I thought up an idea for putting LED stickers on the bottom of glass beer bottles. We figured that we could sell them to beer distributors as a way to promote their glass bottle offerings. The trouble is, the cost of LEDs plus batteries plus stickers is currently too much to make the offer tenable. The price of the promotion needs to be some small fraction of the gross margin on the bottles for this to be attractive to the distributors.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had this idea about a year ago and we haven't though much about it since. It would be great if there was a company that aggregated ideas like the one above and came up with the criteria for when the idea would actually be economically viable. The company would monitor the inputs: the prices of LEDs, stickers, and batteries. It would also monitor the constraints: the gross margin on glass beer bottles, the total consumption of these bottles. The company might even work with distributors to get them on board before the idea even becomes tenable. The company would then take these inputs and constraints and come up with a equation for when the idea would make economic sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          By periodically reviewing a large pool of ideas with similar structure to the one above, the company would routinely find ideas that have recently become economically viable. Having a large pool of ideas to select from that have recently become economically viable would be a very valuable service. The company could distribute this value in the form of information, or in the form of implementing the idea using one of its subsidiaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of company would be extremely exciting to work for because they'd always be dealing with the newest possible ideas that could actually work. It would be exciting to run a report daily, and see that two of our 1 million stored ideas have become economically viable over night.

      <title>Title Insurance Prices</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
          Title insurance is this idea that the title of your home might be encumbered by some liens and the person you are selling it to might be worried that they don't have the right to buy the property and would get embroiled in legal issues. Title insurance insures agains tthis happening, and in the case that it does they are the ones who pay for it. They should only be charging a rate that is close to what they pay out handling these claims, but I don't believe this is happening. I tried to search for title insurance prices on google but it came up with nothing. I decided that I will try to compile a list of prices people paid for title insurance.

      <title>Cutting Out the Midddleman</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Cutting out the middleman is one of the best things you can do to improve service, satisfaction, price and overall system efficiency. In supply chain theory there is a concept called the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullwhip_effect'>Bullwhip Effect</a>. It says that the more middlemen you introduce into a supply chain the less efficient it can be. As a distributor makes an order he causes demand to whip up as seen the upstream supply chain members and even when obeying the most efficient ordering algorithm, the upstream member has to order more than the demand, leading to a amplification of the demand. Left unchecked this demand can get out of hand and become a giant surplus.</p>
        <p>Middlemen are not only inefficient, but they are also costly. Consider how many people are required to deliver a piece of real estate(e.g. your home for example) to you. You have the 2 realtors and their brokerages, 2 lawyers and their firms, a house inspector, a pest inspector, two banks, a title insurance company, an appraiser, and city, county, state, and federal government agents. <strong>Each of these people makes enough money to do real estate transactions full time</strong> (except the government, they do not know how to make money.). People are the largest expense of any company, and they certainly are the largest expense of any real estate transaction. If you can get rid of any of these middlemen or decrease their compensation you can save a lot of money on a real estate transaction. One example to look into, if you are selling your home, is <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_fee_MLS'>Flat-fee MLS</a> listing. With a flat listing fee you can save up to 3% of the sale price of your home.</p>
        <p>Middlemen can also leave you less satisfied. When is the last time you bought a new car and felt satisfied? With the way car dealers haggle, you know that someone else out there is getting a better price, and you always have to weigh the stress induced by haggling you before you get into it. The fact is car dealers make their money by selling cars in volume and since they buy their cars at a fixed price from the manufacturers, they care a lot about selling each car for as much as they can. It would be great if we could cut out the car dealerships and buy cars from an automotive department store? This is what CarMax has done with used cars. They sell all makes of used cars at a reasonable sticker price and they do not haggle. This leaves their customers feeling more satisfied: they got the same deal anyone else would have gotten, and they did not have deal with the stress of haggling.</p>
        <p>The effect of the Internet that has done the most good for humanity has been removing middlemen. It is has become so easy to set up an online store that many factories and manufacturers are beginning to sell their goods online. Even if they haven't begun to do so, the <a href='http://www.pololu.com'>new manufacturers</a> are.</p>
        <p>A lot of great businesses were founded with the idea of taking out the middleman. GEICO takes out the middleman of having an insurance agent. The Foam Factory <a href='../blog/memory-foam-mattress'>sells cheap memory foam mattresses direct</a>. If you are thinking of starting a business, one of the surest ways to achieve customer goodwill is to take out a middleman. When you take out a middleman, customers go from spending more money to less. When you save customers money, they love you.</p>
        <p>What middlemen have you dealt with recently and how could you have avoided it?</p>]]>

      <title>Cheap Memory Foam Mattress</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
          The Tempurpedic mattress commercials have always intrigued me. The promise is great: a material that conforms to your body without poking you the way coiled spring mattresses do. This was enough to make me want to try one. I went to a local mattress store to try one and was amazed by two things. One was how good the bed felt underneath me, and two was the price. The beds cost at least 5 times as much as comparable coiled spring mattresses. This was confusing because the process for making a foam bed is actually a simpler process than constructing many metal coils and putting them in the right orientation. With a foam bed all you need is a mold of the right size and the right mix of materials at the correct temperature. My gut told me someone would be selling these beds for less.
        </p>
        <p>
          After searching the internet for about a day, I stumbled upon The Foam Factory's website for <a href='http://www.mattressbymail.com/memorymattress.html'>Memory Foam Mattresses</a>. With prices 5 times less than Tempurpedic, comparable quality, and free shipping these beds are amazing. I bought a Twin 5" LUX-HQ 4" 4.5LB Memory for $254.99 + 20 for the nicer cover and had it shipped to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mattress came compressed in tight plastic wrapping, which made it take up less space than it does now. After I took it out of the plastic wrap it started to expand. Once fully expanded it was ready to use, and felt great to lie down in. The strangest sensation is when you go to plop down on your bed, you expect it to feel the same way a coiled spring mattress feels, but it feels totally different. So far I haven't gotten used to this difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have only slept in it for 2 night so far, and I don't have any complaints, but stay tuned for an update.

      <title>Compact Fluorescent Lightbulb Efficiency</title>

        <p>
          Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs (CFLs) are quite the rage in home lighting these days. I've replaced most of the bulbs in my house with CFLs. Let us examine the energy and financial efficiencies of these bulbs.
        </p>
        <h2>Energy Efficiencies</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>input</b> of lightbulbs is their power consumption. Power consumption is measured in Watts. The <b>output</b> of lightbulbs is how bright it is. Brightness is measured in lumens.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common type of CFL is the 13 watt lightbulb. It is the replacement for the common 60 Watt incandescent bulb. Table 1 shows relevant inputs and outputs for these two bulbs.
        </p>
        <table class='centered'>
          <tr>
            <th colspan='4' style='text-align: center'>
              <a href='#Table1' name='Table1'>Table 1</a>
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>
              Input Power (Watt)
            </th>
            <th>
              Output Light (Lumen)
            </th>
            <th>
              Luminous Efficacy (Lumen/Watt)
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Incandescent
            </th>
            <td>
              60
            </td>
            <td>
              850
            </td>
            <td>
              850/60 ≅ 14.16
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Compact Fluorescent
            </th>
            <td>
              13
            </td>
            <td>
              900
            </td>
            <td>
              900/13 ≅ 69.23
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          CFLs have a higher lumen output and a lower watt input resulting in almost 5 times greater efficacy. Note though, that I don't say efficiency. Efficiency is a dimensionless quantity, and Lumen/Watt is not dimensionless. If you had a lightbulb that gave off 1000 Lumens at 9 Watts. You would compute its luminous efficacy to be 111 (1000/9). 111 is greater than the maximum energy efficiency you could have (100%). If your lightbulb is greater than 100% efficient it would mean that it actually created energy out of nowhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          To compute a bulbs efficiency we need the theoretical maximum luminous efficacy. The theoretical maximum represents a lightbulb that turned all of its power into visible light photons. The theoretical maximum luminous efficacy is 683.002 Lumen/Watt. Give this, the luminous efficiency is given by the luminous efficacy divided by the maximum efficacy. The results of this computation are seen in Table 2.
        </p>
        <table class='centered'>
          <tr>
            <th colspan='2' style='text-align: center'>
              <a href='#Table2' name='Table2'>Table 2</a>
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>
              Luminous Efficiency
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Incandescent
            </th>
            <td>
              14.16/683.002 ≅ 2%
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Compact Fluorescent
            </th>
            <td>
              69.23/683.002 ≅ 10%
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          So in the case of CFLs 10% of the power consumed is being converted into light. Ideally we want 100% of the energy to be converted into light, but 10% is 5 times better than the incandescent bulbs at 2%.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we swap incandescents for the more efficient CFLs we will realize a significant energy savings. Incandescents use 60 watts and CFLs use 13 watts. The difference is 47 watts. If we take that over the useful life of a CFL bulb, 10,000 hours, we get 470 kW hours of savings. At a usage rate of 3 hours per day, you can use 51.5 kW hours fewer a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          From an energy perspective, CFLs represent a significant improvement over prior bulbs. Energy savings alone is not a reason to do something though. If CFLs cost $500 per bulb you would not want to pay for one. Let's see if we can really afford these bulbs.
        </p>
        <h2>Financial Efficiencies</h2>
        <p>
          To decide whether to invest in CFLs we need to decide if the Net Present Value (NPV) of the bulb switch investment is positive. To upgrade the bulbs capital must be invested. Since you have to have at least one kind of bulb the capital invested is the difference in price between a CFL bulb ($2.74) and a incandescent bulb ($0.36). This investment yields two distinct returns. The first is the energy savings. If we assume an energy cost of 10 cents per kilowatt hour, the switch saves 43 cents each month. The second is replacement savings. Incandescent bulbs are rated for 1000 hours of use and CFLs are rated for 10,000 hours of use. Each year we forgo the replacement cost of an incandescent bulb.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since cash in the future is not as good as cash now (cash now can be invested in other things) we must use NPV to calculate how much this is worth to us. The NPV calculation discounts cash returns in the future. The rate of discount is based on some rate of return we think we can get doing something else. For instance, at the time of writing the US 10 year bond is at 3.83%. So if you invested your capital in a US bond instead of a lightbulb would you come out ahead? That's what we aim to ask by using NPV. It turns out that <b>the NPV for the CFL investment is $44.73</b>. Since this number is positive, it means that investing in CFLs is a good option compared to investing in US Bonds.
        </p>

          It is useful to look at your break even point. Say you are only living in a place for a short time. If you move before the break even point you will have wasted cash buying CFLs. If you move after the break-even point, the CFLs will be worth it to you. The break even point is the time when the Net Present Value first becomes positive. In this case, <b>the break even point for the CFL investment is at 8 months</b>. At 8 months, you will have recouped your investment and made 17 cents.

          Another useful number is your return on investment. The capital outlay is $2.37 and the total return is $57.42. The return on investment is <b>2422%</b> over 9 years.

          CFLs appear to be a good investment vehicle for people looking to earn great returns on their capital. Unfortunately it does not scale well. Once you have invested capital in all of your lightbulbs you cannot continue to achieve such large returns on investment.
