          <p>
            My first nap was at 1700. I think I may have drifted into sleep for a couple of minutes. When I woke I was not particularly tired. I am anticipating getting much more tired, and coming up with things to do. Here are some ideas I have, post more if you have them:

            2100 Nap (Tiredness: 4, Mood: 6)
          </h3>
          <p>
            During my second nap I was also able to sleep some. It seemed to go by faster than the first nap. It was weird, I told my dad, "See you Later" then 30 minutes later I came back down stairs and continued to hang out with him. Kinda cool. I started to play more pool during this cycle. I then went and watche Apocalypto which was a pretty good movie. I'm not sure if it is a bad idea to be watching movies because they might make me sleepy because I'm not actively participating in them.
