# What is a Trigger Point? {#what-is-a-trigger-point}

A Trigger Point is a spot in your muscle that has gotten irritated
and forms a tight balled up part of the muscle. Trigger points are
painful to touch or at least when moderate pressure is applied. When
your muscles have bad trigger point or lots of trigger points in
them, they can become tight overall and pull on the tissues and
joints they are connected to.

Trigger points can often be treated so they go away completely and
changes in body mechanics, stretching, and massage can keep them from
coming back.

There are a bunch of common places where trigger points form. The
first place I learned about is the calf muscles. My calf muscles were
very tight and had a few different trigger points in them. Andrea
taught me that if I press on the trigger points and massage them they
will hurt, but afterward they will feel more relaxed. Sometimes you
have to push hard enough that the muscle becomes inflamed for a few
days in order to make a change in the tissue, but I recommend starting
with light pressure and seeing it that helps.

Another common place to have a trigger point is in your upper
trapezius. You will commonly see people massaging the area where the
trapezius meets the upper shoulder. If you have a desk job and your
upper body posture is not good, you will probably have an insanely
tight upper trapezius with plenty of trigger points in it.

Since you should [not be harboring pain](#your-body-should-not-harbor-pain),
trigger points should be addressed. Ideally, all of your muscles
will not have any painful regions in them when you massage them. It
is amazing to feel how different your calf muscle can feel if you go
from having lots of tightness to having a supple and smooth
muscle. It can almost turn into an obsession to clean out all of the
trigger points that are in your muscles.

Be careful and go easy at first. If you go too hard. you can bruise
your muscles or cause a nasty inflammation that makes the muscles
tense up even more. After you have worked on an area, give it a
chance to rest and recover before going at it again. Also, keep in
mind that maintaining your muscles can take less time than waiting
for trigger points to build up and get worse before working on them.
