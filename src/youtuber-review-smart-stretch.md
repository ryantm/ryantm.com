# YouTuber Review Smart Stretch {#youtuber-review-smart-stretch}

2015-04-10

As part of a new series, I will review YouTuber channels that I find
useful and interesting. First up is
[Smart Stretch](https://www.youtube.com/user/smartstretch/videos).

I like Smart Stretch because the channel is thorough, soothing, and
covers stretching most of the body. Watching the videos puts me into a
good mood and makes me feel confident that the videos demonstrate good
form.

If your hamstrings are tight, and they probably are if you are reading
this while sitting in a chair, he has a video on
[active isolated stretching of the hamstring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvLSoHeSDBY).
It is also inspiring to see someone with so much flexibility. It gives
me an aspirational inspiration.
