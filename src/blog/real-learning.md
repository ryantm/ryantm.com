# Real Learning {#real-learning}

2007-05-05

Developing the "secret project" that Alan and I are working on has been a lot of work. Throughout the project, Alan has been saying "This is crazy.", which I tend to agree with him sometimes. We have been learning a lot through the project and also accomplishing our goals a lot too. Here's what we've been learning. (By learning I mean, actually learning it, not the crap they do at Universities)

* BNF grammar
* Recursive descent parsing
* Ruby module programming
* Data structures
* Behaviorally driven development

All of these are leading us to be better programmers and letting us learn a lot. Also the end product should be a lot of fun when we get it done.
