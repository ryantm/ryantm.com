  Title insurance is this idea that the title of your home might be encumbered by some liens and the person you are selling it to might be worried that they don't have the right to buy the property and would get embroiled in legal issues. Title insurance insures agains tthis happening, and in the case that it does they are the ones who pay for it. They should only be charging a rate that is close to what they pay out handling these claims, but I don't believe this is happening. I tried to search for title insurance prices on google but it came up with nothing. I decided that I will try to compile a list of prices people paid for title insurance.
