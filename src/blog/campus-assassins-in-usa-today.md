My website [http://www.campusassassins.com](http://www.campusassassins.com) is featured in this [USA Today Article](http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2007-04-24-student-assassin-game_N.htm) Hopefully my quotation in it is correct:

>  I hope it's just a localized anomaly," [I] said. "I don't think it will affect things in the long run. But definitely people will have to re-evaluate how they play the game."

Our site uses Ruby on Rails.
