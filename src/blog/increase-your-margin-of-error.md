  Your body is an adaptive system. No two bodies are the same because
  they have all adapted to different stresses placed on them. Cyclists
  develop big quads, and rowers develop the shoulders and arms. Your
  body is strengthening in response to stress and atrophying from
  disuse.

%p
  The upside to this is that if you can keep the various parts of your
  body mildly stressed you can keep your body in a state of global
  improvement, where all parts are getting better simultaneously.

  The downside is, if you are like me, probably do not have much of what
  engineers call a margin of error. The margin of error of your body is
  how far you have to challenge it beyond your normal routine before
  some part of the system fails. Your body is always adapting to your
  environment, and it works to minimize the energy expended. This was
  great for your ancestors who could eat fewer calories because the
  muscles they did not need were not getting big. But not so great for
  modern you living in a calorie-rich environment.

%p
  This adaptation means your body becomes just barely good enough to
  handle the maximum stresses placed on it throughout your routine. On
  my path to increasing my overall physical fitness, I had a few moments
  when I realized some routine task in my life was a lot easier than it
  used to be.

  My wife and I do not sleep in a bed. We sleep on a mattress on the
  floor. When we get up, we go from squat to stand. I never thought
  about this motion being difficult for me, but once I had developed my
  squatting strength, I noticed I could much more easily get out of
  bed. On the flip side, before I started working on my squatting
  muscles, I was on the verge of not being able to get out of bed!

%p
  I have noticed similar situations when balancing on one leg to put on
  my shorts, easing myself down onto a toilet seat, and picking up my
  wife while hugging her (she wants me to say it is all due to her
  weight going down).

%p
  All these routine actions had such a low margin of error, that I was
  always living on the edge of making one stressful move that would lead
  me to fall or hurt my back. You may think you are far away from the
  old lady you see using a walker, but I am afraid that most of our
  margins of error are so small that we are not far away from that at
  all.

%p
  Let us build our margin of error in our daily activities. By putting
  short but intense stresses on all of the parts of my body, I believe I
  will continue to build my margin of error. Constantly listen to your
  body and look for where your margin of error has gotten too thin. You
  will know when it happens, it is called pain.
