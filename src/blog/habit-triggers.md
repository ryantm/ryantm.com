# Habit Triggers {#habit-triggers}

2015-03-30

A trigger for a habit is an event that happens right before you do
your add-on habit. If the trigger is already a memorable and strong
part of your routine, it can serve as a good foundation to lay on
other habits.

I am working on developing the habit of writing after I get home from
work. The habit is writing and the trigger is getting home from
work. You can think of these trigger to habit as like neural pathways:
they get stronger the more them and atrophy with disuse. Every time I
write a post after coming home from work, my mind becomes more
accustomed to this being the automatic behavior. It becomes the
behavior that my subconscious mind becomes addicted to. It is the
pattern that it cannot help but fulfill. Your habits become drugs you
are addicted to.

Have you ever noticed that you remember very well the first few times
you are learning how to do a task, but after it becomes part of your
routine it fades into the background of your life as an automatic and
effortless action? This is how it feels when you reinforce the
pathways between triggers and habits. At first they are weak and you
can easily stop doing the add-on habit. But by reinforcing the pathway
time and time again, you can hardly help yourself from doing it.

A good trigger is something in your life that is already a positive
part that you want to keep. A good trigger is something you do
regularly and easily. I have wrote about some of these triggers before
but here is a combined list of triggers you might be able to use to
add on positive habits yourself:

* Brushing your teeth
* Flossing
* Getting dressed (before or after)
* Taking a shower
* Putting on deodorant
* Going to work
* Coming back from work
* A day of the week
* Walking through a doorway, hallway, or passageway
* Sunrise or sunset
* Getting in or out of your car
* Stopped at a stoplight or in traffic
* Before you eat
* After you eat
* While you wait for the microwave/oven/cooking
* Waiting in a line
* At a meeting
* Before, during, or after exercise

Many of these triggers are probably already available in your
life. Are you taking advantage of them to help develop positive habits
in your life? How many of the triggers above produce a positive
behavior for you? How many of them trigger a banal habit "look
at my cellphone"? What are some other triggers you can think of that
we can benefit from adding a habit onto?
