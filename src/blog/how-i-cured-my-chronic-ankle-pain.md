  Actually, it was not me. Andrea gets all the credit for this one!

  My chronic ankle pain started four years ago when I was playing soccer
  with my co-workers, and I got an ankle sprain that I did not think was
  that bad. I was barely feeling the acute pain after only a couple of
  days: a happily swift recovery.

%p
  Unfortunately, I began to notice that I had a twinge of pain in my
  ankle when I walked on it. It would be particularly bad after getting
  up from a chair and it would come and go. It never annoyed me enough
  to seek help but I asked Andrea (my girlfriend and student of physical
  therapy at the time) to look at it. She performed all the ankle tests
  she knew and none of them produced any obvious results. It seemed like
  my ankle was strong and healthy. The question was, why was the pain
  still there though? It would bother me occasionally and at some point
  I was resigned to having these ankle pains for the rest of my life.

  Luckily for me though, a physical therapy student eventually becomes
  an experienced physical therapist. Experienced physical therapists
  know that the body is a complex system with the parts of the body
  connected in a chain. Also, pain felt in one place might be caused by
  a problem in another.

  One night, I said "I wonder if I will have this ankle pain forever."
  Andrea said, "You know, I wonder if it is actually your hip." She
  did a couple of tests and suggested some hip strengthening exercises
  that I could do that might help.

%p
  It amazes me that since that night, I basically have had no episodes
  of this chronic pain that had been slightly annoying me for almost
  three years. That is some precision knowledge deployment there! As
  long as I keep my hip strong, I probably will never have to feel that
  pain again.

  I think a lot of people might be able to benefit from similar
  experiences. Do not stay quiet about your chronic pains, even if they
  are small. Research them, try doing light strengthening exercises to
  help alleviate the issue. If it does not get better, seek the advice
  of your doctor or physical therapist. The longer you wait to treat a
  chronic malady the harder it will be to remediate.
