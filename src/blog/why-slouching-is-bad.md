  When I was little I got some cues from adults that slouching is bad
  and that I should try to maintain good posture. Until recently, I
  never really took their advice to heart. I do not recall anyone
  explaining to me why I should not slouch and at some point, no one
  reminded me about slouching anymore during class or at home in front
  of the computer. I will try make a case for why it is bad.

  Even though I have internalized this case, I still have not conquered
  my slouching habits. When I am focusing and using a computer, my
  posture suffers greatly. But, by being mindful of my posture, I think
  I am steadily increasing the percentage of time that I am not in a
  terrible position.

  I see you shifting in your chair as you read this. Get comfy and
  balanced as we build our case against slouching.

  When you slouch you support your body through your spine and the discs
  in your spine. It is like you are hanging your body off of your
  spine. With good posture, your body weight is supported through your
  muscles that wrap around your body. Your muscles are much better at
  taking load and abuse of the weight of your body than your vertebra
  and discs. Your muscles heal more quickly and respond to stresses by
  getting stronger. Your bones and discs are not good at responding to
  stresses and eventually can be worn down from repeated stresses. When
  slouching, people tend to have the head far out of alignment from
  where it would be in a neutral postural position. The more out of
  alignment it is the more force your body (probably your spine if you
  are slouching) needs to generate to keep you from falling over.

  I think that the sudden rib pain I was feeling in my left ribcage was
  because I was crushing the little muscles that are between the
  ribs. Since I started slouching less and building up the muscles that
  support this region, I have not had any shooting or sudden pain in my
  ribs.

  Slouching also reduces the size of your lung cavity. Some of the
  muscles that are responsible for posture are also responsible for
  breathing. If you maintain a good posture, these muscles will be
  stronger and more capable in helping you breathe. If you slouch for
  most of the day, you might even find these postural breathing muscles
  have atrophied to the point where they can barely be activated. The
  muscles that move when you breathe while slouching will have to work
  harder. You also probably will not get the full range of motion of
  your diaphragm. You will not be getting good "deep" breaths that fill
  your lungs.

  Lastly, by slouching or resting your body on the back of a chair, you
  are depriving yourself of balancing practice. When you use your
  postural muscles, they have to maintain your balance so you do not
  move or fall. This might not seem like much, but having good balance
  and proprioception is important for all the movements you make with
  your body. Good sense of body position will make you more likely to
  assume a good position while performing an activity that you have not
  developed your skill at. Overall, the better your balance and postural
  muscles are the less likely you will put yourself into a compromising
  position and get yourself hurt.

  Well there it is, the case for why we should not slouch. It is a noble
  goal, but also a hard to achieve one. Be mindful of your position and
  you will improve your posture over time. Choose to go down the path
  toward improved posture one step at a time. We have years of bad
  habits to break down, but thankfully we all have plenty of time to do
  it!
