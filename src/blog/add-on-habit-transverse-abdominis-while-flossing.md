  Your abdominal muscles are composed of a few layers of sheets of
  muscles. The part people often focus on are their Rectus Abdominis
  muscles, also known as, "The Six Pack". While this muscle serves as
  a popular indicator of a person who is in shape, the other muscles
  in your abdominal region are arguably more important to overall core
  strength, spinal protection, and postural position.

%p
  I would like to focus on the Transverse Abdominis. The Transverse
  Abdominis are the most internal or deep abdominal muscle. They wrap
  around your whole front and stabilize the trunk when it
  contracts. They are also used during breathing where they help
  change the shape of the cavity your lungs are in.

%p
  An easy way to activate the Transverse Abdominis is to "suck in" your
  gut. This is also sometimes called "stomach vacuuming". Well
  developed, and strong Transverse Abdominis muscles will allow you to
  move your gut in so that it is more internal that your rib cage, and
  you will see the outline of your rib cage if you look at yourself in a
  mirror while doing the exercise. By holding your stomach inward, you
  are contracting and working the Transverse Abdominis. You can also
  work it by slowly and purposefully moving from all the way sucked in
  to all the way bulged out. When you bulge out your abdominal region,
  you are working other muscles more, but your Transverse Abdominis
  moves along with and will be stretched through its range of motion.

%p
  I add this stomach vacuuming exercise onto my habit of flossing my
  teeth twice a day. While I am flossing, I either keep my Transverse
  Abdominis contracted, or I move it in and out. You can add this on
  to any time where you are standing up. For example, you might do it
  in the checkout line at the store, or while you are washing your
  hair in the shower. There are really a lot of places you can add a
  few Transverse Abdominis workouts.

%p
  The benefits of working this muscle group is that, as it tones, your
  stomach will be much more flat because it will pull your stomach
  inward. It will also help you breathe more effectively and help you
  protect your spine from injury. When you make this muscle stronger,
  the harder-to-exercise complimentary muscles in your back will also
  get stronger because they will need to keep up with your stronger
  Transverse Abdominis.

%p
  I strongly recommend giving this a try, because when I started doing
  it, I noticed immediately that my stomach looked better and
  healthier. You do not need to be all the way to having a six-pack to
  be producing a much stronger and nicer looking group of core muscles.
