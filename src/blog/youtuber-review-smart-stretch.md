# youtuber review smart stretch {#youtuber-review-smart-stretch}
%p
  As part of a new series, I will review YouTuber channels that I find
  useful and interesting. First up is
  #{link_to "Smart Stretch","https://www.youtube.com/user/smartstretch/videos"}.

%p
  I like Smart Stretch because the channel is thorough, soothing, and
  covers stretching most of the body. Watching the videos puts me into a
  good mood and makes me feel confident that the videos demonstrate good
  form.

  If your hamstrings are tight, and they probably are if you are reading
  this while sitting in a chair, he has a video on
  #{link_to "active isolated stretching of the hamstring", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvLSoHeSDBY"}.

%p
  It is also inspiring to see someone with so much flexibility. It gives
  me an aspirational inspiration.
