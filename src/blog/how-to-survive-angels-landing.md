# How to survive Angel's Landing {#how-to-survive-angels-landing}

2012-06-30

I recently hiked Angel’s Landing at Zion National Park with my
girlfriend. We are both 26 and in fairly good shape. The hike to Scout
Lookout is strenuous, uphill for 2 miles. The last 0.5 miles up to
Angel’s Landing is technical and dangerous. The sign says 6 people
have died since 2004. We brought about 3.5 liters of water and we ran
out at the last mile going down. Here are my tips for making it more
likely that you will survive:

* Go early. The first shuttles start as early as 6AM some times of the
  year. We got going on the hike at about 8 AM in June and the first
  part of the trail (even before the refrigerator canyon) was
  shaded. This made the first part of the trail much more enjoyable.
* Use open-finger gloves. Gloves let you hold onto, and run your hand
  along the chains without hurting your hands. I bought some gloves on
  sale at REI for $12. Amazon has some nice pairs as well. [Avenir

* Use a hydration backpack. A hydration backpack allows you to drink
  water while keeping your hands free. Some of the spaces along the
  route are tight enough that you will not have space to put down a
  bag. I used the [Camelbak Vantage Hydration
  Pack])http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ZV58E6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B006ZV58E6&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanmull-20),
  which is a lovely versatile pack.
* Use the three-point technique as much as possible. The three-point
  technique is where you always have three points in contact with the
  ground or chain at all times. For example, both hands on the chain
  and one foot on the ground. Or one hand on the chain and two feet on
  the ground.
* Keep your weight over your feet. It might seem counter intuitive if
  you are not a rock climber, but you get a lot more traction if you
  keep your weight above your feet. Sticking your butt out while
  scrambling upward can help keep your weight over your feet and avoid
  slipping.
* Avoid sand. Parts of the trail are covered in sand. Avoid stepping
  in or near these parts of the trail because sand is effectively a
  lubricant. The one time I slipped on the trail was in a spot with
  sand. Luckily it was no where near the edge and I did not actually
  fall over.
* Don’t look down. Some people get sick when they look down from
  heights. If you do, I don’t recommend going. If you insist, don’t
  look down. Some parts are scary even for us regular folk.
* If you follow these tips, you should have a much more pleasant
  hike. Best of luck on your Angel’s Landing hike.
