# always have a project {#always-have-a-project}

  Wanting to keep improving means always having a project that you are
  working on. In the context of improving my physical health, I now
  always have a few projects I am working on. Having these projects
  helps focus my improvement activities and helps keep my positive as I
  notice myself improving in those areas.

  Working on increasing the mobility of the tissues in my upper left arm
  is one of my projects. I can feel that when I raise my left arm
  straight up, my shoulder sometimes pops and I feel the left scapular
  muscles on stretch or sticking. It is quite different from how the
  same motion consistently feels on the right side. To work on it, I
  have been mobilizing the tissues in the area and trying to think about
  daily habits that might be contributing to the tightness. I have not
  been doing as much strengthening as I should. If my triceps were in
  better shape, I think it would help the situation a lot.

  Another project is my left hip. My left hip joint harbors some pain
  when I touch the joint capsule. I have been working on trigger points
  in my IT band and gluteus medius. Also, I am focusing on activating my
  gluteus medius to keep my hip in better positions. Recently, Andrea
  helped me loosen up my IT band considerably by attacking some trigger
  points in it, and I noticed I am getting less medial pain in my knee
  while biking even while increasing intensity.

  The other project I am working on is getting a six-pack. I know what
  you are thinking, "how clich√©". But I feel like having strong core
  muscles and a lean body is an important general indicator of health
  and seeing my muscles starting to grow out of nowhere when I look in
  the mirror is a great feeling. Spousal compliments in this area also
  reinforce and encourage. For this, I am trying to do planks somewhat
  regularly and I am bicycling to work almost every day for roughly 50
  miles of cycling a week. By making sure to engage my core muscles
  while cycling, I think it is slowly helping build these muscles.

  These are just my current top-of-my-mind projects on body health. If
  one of them starts to get completed or stops improving quickly, I
  might switch over to another goal, or seek outside help to help
  improve. I think it is important to have some focus. Having just a few
  goals to work on lets you assess your situation and progress
  better. It also lets you pay attention to the small factors that might
  be affecting these particular projects.

  Another reason to have projects is that if you do not, what will you
  work on? Being aimless in your health or other life goals is a sure
  way to look back and feel like you wasted your time. They say when
  people retire if they have a hobby or friends to hang out with they
  will live for a lot longer. I think this same concept applies in a
  less extreme way to all of the various aspects of your life. If you do
  not have a project in that area of your life, that area is probably
  slowly dying.

  Maybe a project you focus on does not work out, but at least you
  worked on it. I feel much better knowing I put effort into trying to
  improve, than I do from looking back at places in my life where I did
  not try. More often, you will find the focus will cause you to improve
  significantly in the areas you are focusing on.

  What projects are you working on?  Do you have a set of projects in
  different areas of your life? These projects are my projects in the
  area of musculoskeletal health. I have other projects in other areas
  of my life. What areas are you trying to constantly improve in?
