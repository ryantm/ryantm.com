# Add on Habit: Screen Time Equals Exercise Time {#add-on-habit-screen-time-equals-exercise-time}

Screen time when you are consuming media might not necessarily be a
positive habit to add on to, but many of us find ourselves in front
of screens watching videos, TV Shows, Movies, and reading books,
news, and blogs. By establishing add on habit, you can make this
relaxing time more productive and fun by adding on some exercises. A
lot of people have discovered the reverse of this. Lots of people
read and watch videos at the gym while they are on some exercise
machine. This is great and I am not proposing you do something this
strenuous. Instead, how about doing some simple stretches, leg
raises, planks, or squats while using those screens?

I think squats are especially good when you are watching a screen
that is far away. You can limit your time sitting and at the same
time open up your hips and build flexibility in your lower body and
lower back. Even a few minutes during your screen time will start to
show big gains.

Another great one I do is leg raises while laying down with my
tablet or book. When you are using your arms to stabilize the screen
(or book), your legs are basically doing nothing. Get them involved
in some hip adductor/abductor strengthening. One easy one is called
"clams". You lie on your side with one leg on top of the other with
your knees bent, and then you slowly separate your knees while
keeping your ankles together. The opening is like the mouth of a
clam. You can do this exercise on both sides. Rotating will help
keep your arms from getting tired too. There are a couple of
variations on this called "straight leg raises". You can also do
them on your back if you want to work on your hamstring
flexibility. I like to sprinkle in these leg exercises randomly as I
am using a screen or reading. It keeps me active during an otherwise
sedentary period.

I think stretching can be an especially good one to do while using a
screen. You can accumulate a good amount of time in various stretches
while watching something without even thinking about it. By hanging
out more in some of the end range of motion, you can develop more
comfort with being in that position. This is how Andrea developed her
flexibility to do the splits during high school. Lots of time spent
stretching while reading.

Screen watching and reading time can have pretty negative results on
your body and overall fitness. By adding a few of these habits into
your screen watching time you can augment these activities with
positive improvements to your body. Just a little motion and activity
can go a long way to reversing the negative effects of laying
motionless and leave you with more flexibility and strength.
