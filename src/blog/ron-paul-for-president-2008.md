If you are looking for someone to vote for in 2008 you should consider Ron Paul. He has many of the core libertarian platform beliefs and he's not afraid to say that other candidates are full of crap. Which he so eloquently exposes. This guy is awesome. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=RonPaul2008dotcom">Watch Him.</a>
