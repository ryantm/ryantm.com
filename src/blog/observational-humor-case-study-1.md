# Observational humor case study 1 {#observational-humor-case-study-1}

2012-11-03

My [Toastmasters](http://www.toastmasters.org) Club, [Powerhouse
Pros](http://www.powerhousepros.com), has a section of the meeting
called Observational Humor.  It is a chance to tell jokes about your
observations throughout the meeting. I will give you the setup of the
jokes and my monologue. Keep in mind that these jokes are meant to be
funny and custom-tailored to the audience.

## The set up

* One speaker, Bobby, quoted someone who said that you only need to do
  humor in public speaking if you want to get paid.
* Bobby also said you need to love your audience as a speaker
* In Bobby’s introduction he said that his Toastmaster Contest
  Trophies were “closeted”
* Our president and Toastmaster Emily provided a pop quiz as part of
  her theme about Multitasking

## The monologue

1. Opener: My mentor Bobby Williams says you only need to do
   observational humor if you want to get paid — a probably true
   statement paralleling a memorable quote from his speech, got good
   laughs
2. I…. Just… Sorry [I am fake crying here]… I love you guys so much —
   callback to Bobby saying we need to love our audiences
3. I also prepared a pop quiz for tonight’s meeting
4. 1. True or false: Men are funnier than women
5. 2. True or false: Humor can improve with practice. (That wasn’t
   funny, it was just a listening comprehension test
6. 3. Performing two or more jokes at the same time can cause fatal
   results.
7. — The quiz used similar structure to the quiz questions that all of
   the participants took.
