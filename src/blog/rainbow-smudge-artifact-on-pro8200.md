# rainbow smudge artifact on pro8200 {#rainbow-smudge-artifact-on-pro8200}
%p==I have a #{link_to "ViewSonic PRO8200 1080p DLP Home Theatre Projector","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00465W7EC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00465W7EC&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanmull-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00465W7EC"}. After cleaning my house, the projector got a artifact that looked like a rainbow smudge. It is not the same as the “rainbow effect” that I read about while trying to research this problem. I thought maybe the front lens got dirty while I was cleaning, so I cleaned that with a microfiber cloth. It didn’t help. I thought maybe some dust had gotten inside and I blew compressed air into the side of the projector. Amazingly, that fixed the problem!
