# Pool Strife, A Billiards Game {#pool-strife}

Pool Strife was created by Jon Syu, and Grant Klafehn, when they were
messing around in my basement one night. It was a fun game, and it
involved all 3 of us. Jon originally suggested the name CardioPool
because of the amount of effort that had to go into playing the game
by running around the table, but we eventually changed the name to
something that would sound more popular, and thus the game was
ordained Pool Strife.

One game is called a War

Wars are broken up into Skirmishes, which are won by best
of 3. Skirmishes are broken up into Battles, and are won by best
of 5. You must win by 2 battles to win the skirmish.

One player is the one ball, one player is the 9 ball.

Balls are setup with one in each opposite cornor pocket, and the 8
ball(or Target) in the very center of the table.

Game Play starts with the referee(or impartial observer in amateur
games) saying "Ready... Set... Go...". The players then shoot for the
8 ball.

The object of the game is to pocket the Target by having your ball be
the last to touch the Target before it goes into a pocket and stays in
the pocket.

To clarify; The owner of the last <u>moving</u> Player Ball to touch
the Target before it enters the pocket is declared the victor of the
Battle.

The referee must keep track of which moving ball last touched the
Target.

A player may only hit his or her ball when it is stationary.

Players move around the table to gain better position to hit their
ball, but they must give way to a person who's ball is moving slower
than their own.

"Head Shot": When a player pockets the Target and the Opposing Player
Ball with the same shot, they recieve 2 battle points, If this is
enough to win the skirmish they win.

## Penalties

* All penalties are awarded by the referee(s). They must say the name
  of the penalty followed by the offender's last name. In regulation
  play there are 3 referees one to watch the Target and one for each
  Player.
* "False Start": If one player strikes their ball before the referee
  says go, the opposing player wins the battle.
* "Scratch": If a player pockets their Player Ball, the game is paused
  and they must place it at the corresponding locations, such that if
  it is pocketed in a side pocket the ball is placed in the very
  center, if it is pocketed in a corner pocket it is placed in the
  center of that end of the table and the opposing player gets a free
  shot.
* "Rolling Scratch": If a player hits their ball before it has stopped
  rolling, play stops, and the opposing player gets a free shot.
* "Failure to Yield": If you do not yield to the other player based on
  the above rules, play stops and the opponent gets a free shot.
