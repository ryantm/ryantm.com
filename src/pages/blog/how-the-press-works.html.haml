  Here is a flow of how the press of America works from my current model of it.<br /><br />4:00 USA Today does interesting story<br />6:00 Radio talk shows pick up story and try to get people mentioned in the article on the air to talk about it the controversy of the story.<br />16:00 TV news stations try find local versions of interesting story by contacting the people mentioned in the story because they might have leads to the local version of the story.<br /><br />It's interesting to see how this works first hand. It seems that a lot of it is quite derivative, more than I had originally suspected. I guess this is a good thing though because it makes a person a lot less likely to 'miss' what is happening in the world, because all the different localities pick up the story and talk about it in their own context.<br /><br />Here is where the news is unfolding, (there is an audio clip of me talking in one of the comments),<br /><a href="http://davidegrayson.livejournal.com/17231.html">http://davidegrayson.livejournal.com/17231.html</a>
