  Today on Freenode#ruby-lang, I was talking to "Defiler" about <a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a>. It sounded great. I'm going to look into working on this open source project over the summer, because it seems worth it, and I could end up learning a whole heck of a lot.<br /><br />Evan, the founder of Rubinius, claims that it is 98% first class. I am interested to find out what that means, but I already know somethings it means. For instance, Methods are first class.<br />This works:<br /><pre><span class=ident>obj</span><span class=punct>.</span><span class=ident>methods</span><span class=punct>[</span><span class=symbol>:my_fibonacci</span><span class=punct>]</span> <span class=punct>=</span> <span class=ident>other_obj</span><span class=punct>.</span><span class=ident>methods</span><span class=punct>[</span><span class=symbol>:fibonacci</span><span class=punct>]</span></pre><br />Also, you can undo the effects of including a module very easily. Defiler says you just remove the module from the "ancestors" of the object and then the include is undone. That's a lot nicer than the messy code I'm going to have to write to undo a 1.8.5 ruby module include.
