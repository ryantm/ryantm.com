  When you are at a meeting is one of the perfect times to work on
  mobilizing sticky tissue in your body. Usually at a meeting you need
  to talk and listen, but what you do with your hands usually does not
  matter (except maybe if you need to take notes). Reclaim this down
  time by adding on the habit of doing soft tissue mobilization while
  having a meeting of the minds with your coworkers.

  My favorite somewhat-discrete mobilization to do at a meeting is to
  work on my calf muscles. I cross my legs, which puts my calf muscle
  nicely in reach of my hands. Then, I massage the knots and tight
  spots of the tissue during the meeting.

  If you regularly have meetings, this can be a great way to remember
  to do some mobilization. Since there are parts of your body that are
  regularly getting tighter and stiffer, it is great to be able to
  regularly address these issues with an add-on habit.

  Another mobilization target that you can do during a meeting is your
  upper Trapezius. You can jab your fingers into this muscle and do a
  functional release by moving your shoulder around looking for tight
  parts of the tissues. The upper Trapezius is another muscle that
  really commonly gets tight for people. This is the muscle tightness
  that makes a upper back massage feel so good when it releases the
  tightness.
