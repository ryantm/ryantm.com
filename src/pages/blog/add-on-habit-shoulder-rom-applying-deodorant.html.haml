  The idea behind this #{link_to "add-on habit", "blog/add-on-habit-toothbrushing-squat/"}
  is that you improve your shoulder range of motion while you apply
  deodorant. Instead of bending your elbow while you lift your
  shoulder to put on deodorant, you keep your palm pointed forward
  (maybe toward a mirror) and your arm completely straight. In this
  position, your arm will be parallel to and in-line with your
  body. The goal is to regain and maintain full range of motion so
  that your arm can be pointing directly upward without rotating your
  rib cage or recruiting any of the muscles in your torso or neck. Do
  each arm while applying deodorant to it. Yay for multitasking!

  When your first start doing this, you may find that you do not have
  full range of motion. Or, that your shoulder capsule is hurting, or
  your triceps are tight, or your rotator cuff muscles are restricting
  the motion. That is okay. The more time you spend at your maximum
  range of motion, the more likely you will be able to increase the
  range to the maximum. Massage your shoulder and triceps before and
  after this motion if you have time.

  I started doing this add-on habit because I realized that my left
  shoulder capsule had pain before I could reach full range of
  motion. Since you generally should not have pain when you move your
  body around or press on it, I knew I needed to work on it. I have
  been doing this practically every day for a year now, and I can
  report that my pain at end range has drastically gone down. I still
  have some tightness in my triceps at left shoulder end range, so I
  will keep working on it. I plan to keep up this habit for the rest
  of my life because it is so easy to add, does not take extra time,
  and will keep my shoulders in good shape.
