  The green or red plus/minus with a number and a percent in parenthesis right under the current stock price is the price move. If it is a positive number it is the difference between the day's low price and the current price. If it is a negative number it is the difference between the day's high price and the current price. Whether it is negative or positive is determined by the current price's relation to the opening price of the day.
