%h1 Vizio CT15-A5 Secure Boot Ubuntu 12.10 Live USB

%p First shrink your Windows partition so you have space to install Ubuntu.

%p Here is how I booted a Live USB Ubuntu 12.10 with secure boot:

%ol
  %li Create USB live key with LiLi
  %li Restart
  %li Repeatedly press F2 to get into the EFI settings
  %li Change Secure boot to disabled
  %li Change OS Support to Other OS
  %li Change boot order to boot from USB key first
  %li Save and exit
  %li It should boot into a purple graphical non secure boot
  %li Alt-ctrl-delete to reboot
  %li Press f2 repeatedly to get into EFI again
  %li Change Secure boot to enabled
  %li Change boot order to boot from UEFI first
  %li Change “UEFI Boot Drive BBS Priorities” to be the USB key
  %li Save and exit
  %li You should see a text-based grub starting screen if it worked. If you booted insecurely, you will see a purple graphic at the start.
  %li During installation, be sure to select “something else” for the partitions and make the partitions you want (I did 4GB of swap and about 118GB for /)

%p After it installs, you should be able to select what OS to boot from in the EFI settings boot priorities.
