%h1 Placism

%blockquote &ldquo;Once we learn to stop being racists, we will have to learn to stop being placists.

%p
  Merriam-Webster dictionary defines racism as:

  %blockquote &ldquo;a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race

%p The same is true for placism. Placists are people who believe a place (or place of origin) is a primary determinant of the traits of people, thoughts, goods, services, and ideas. Placism is at best a mistaken belief and at worst a demagogues tool for enslaving a populace. It is my intention to speak out against this mental mistake that so many of us make, to make light of our deep-rooted placism, so that we can become better thinkers and people; so that we can rout out the hatred bred by placism and increase our chances for peace.
