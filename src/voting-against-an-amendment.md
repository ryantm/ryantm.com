# Voting against an amendment {#voting-against-an-amendment}

2013-1-28

At the Clark County Republican Central Committee meeting, there was a
resolution about gun control and the recent Sandy Hook incident. The
resolution had language talking about the killer using an assault
rifle. A man made a motion to amend the resolution because he said
that it had been recently learned that the killer had an assault rifle
in his car, but did not use it in the killings. He vaguely asked to
amend it to remove mention of the assault rifle from the
resolution. The man argued that we should remove mention of the killer
using an assault rifle because, otherwise, we would be lying. When the
vote commenced and the nays voted, the man who made the motion got up,
and pointed at people close by to him who voted nay and shouted “Liar,
Liar, Liar!”.

The man who made this motion was wrong and extremely impolite to call
these people liars. Here are some reasons for voting nay without
needing to lie:

1. You agree with the man, but disliked his vague amendment. You would
   like to propose a more clear (or better worded) alternative after
   the motion is dispensed with. Or, you want to vote against
   amendments in general, unless the exact changes are clearly
   presented.
2. You plan to vote against his amendment and against the adoption of
   the resolution.
3. You agree with the man, but not with the resolution as a whole and
   want it to contain lies to make it less likely to pass.
4. You do not believe the man, and would like to table the resolution
   until better proof is made available.
5. You dislike the man (who wouldn’t dislike someone who shouts at
   people and calls them liars?) and want to vote against anything he
   proposes.
