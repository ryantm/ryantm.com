The MUD IRC room is a great place to network. Many informed MUDers
gather there to discuss MUD design, play, and implementation. The
official IRC chat for MUDs is

```
  #mud @ irc.freenode.net
```

This IRC is also for MU*s of any kind.

If you aren't familiar with IRC here is an easy way to get started:

go to [https://www.mibbit.com/](https://www.mibbit.com/)

Fill in the fields like this:

```
Nickname: YourNameHere
Server:   irc.freenode.net
Channel   #mud
```
then click "Login".

This will open a connection. You now can chat! My nickname is
RyanTM. Type something like : "RyanTM: Hello sir" And I'll try to
respond quickly to you.
