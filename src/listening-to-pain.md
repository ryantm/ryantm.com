# Listening to Pain {#listening-to-pain}

In addition to recognizing your body should
[not be harboring pain](#your-body-should-not-harbor-pain),
you should listen intently and react quickly to the pain you
feel. Throw out the phrase "no pain no gain", and the idea of
"powering through" a workout or exercise. You only get one body; do
not screw it up with short-term thinking! If you knew could only have
one car for the rest of your life, would you be a more careful driver?
I am surprised when I see people beating on their bodies when they are
clearly feeling pain.

I am not saying you should never feel any pain, just that if you
continue to have pain doing an activity, you need to change the way
you are going about it. For all but a professional athlete, this
should be easy advice to follow. Look at what you are doing and what
hurts and try to figure out what is going on. Take it easy. Slowly
build up your workload. Work complimentary muscles to help support
problematic areas. Look for problems in your form, posture, and
technique. But, for the sake of your one and only body that you were
given in this life, do not keep doing what you are doing!

Recently, I have been biking to work almost every day. It is a 6.5
mile bike ride each way. I noticed that my knees were starting to
hurt. I took many corrective actions. First, I immediately decreased
my cycling intensity so the pain subsided. Second, I mobilized the
tissues surrounding the knee joint and continued to strengthen my hip
muscles. Third, I researched bike posture and fitting to see if I had
a problem. I found that bike seat was too low and this was putting
additional pressure on my knees because I was not going through a
complete-enough range of motion in my knee. Increasing my saddle
height has reduced my knee pain significantly, and I have been able to
pedal harder than before too!

If you keep riding into your pains and aches without regard for them,
you will find yourself at a surgeons office. After surgery, you will
probably never be able to reach your peak functioning
again. Preventing injuries before they become serious requires
building up the habit of listening to your body. You never know when a
slight twinge can develop into a trigger point or muscle tear. You do
not need to be paranoid but at the same time do not be blind when an
injury is brewing in your body.
