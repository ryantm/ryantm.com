            <p>
              I decided to start two don't break the chain habits today, 1 Feb 2008.<br /><ol><li>Write a blog post every day.</li><li>Do sit ups or push ups and stretching every day.</li></ol>I have been spending too much of my time reading and processing other people's writings and not enough time practicing thinking and writing down my thoughts. As such, I propose that I practice thinking and communicating by writing down what I'm thinking at least once a day. I don't think that every post I write will be good, or even polished, but I think that getting into the habit of writing will allow me to improve upon my communication skills. Keep in mind that Albert Einstein once said:<br /><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><span class="body"></span><span class="body">Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.</span><br /></blockquote>I need to get un-lazy and start thinking for myself and communicating my thoughts with others. Too many times have I thought something interesting, and kept it to myself. Hey, even if the ideas aren't that good at least they will be out in the open so others can think about them and revise them if they find any value in them.<br /><br /><span class="bodybold"> </span><br />The second habit is to get myself back in shape. I've been having some lower back pains from playing dodgeball recently. By doing sit ups, I will be strengthening my abdominal muscles which will help to strengthen their complementary lumbar muscles. Hopefully this will help alleviate my back pain.  Also, I want to be able to touch my toes! Currently, I can't touch my toes while keeping my legs straight. I would like to be a lot more flexible than I am now.<br /><br />Well, if you are reading this and you know my personally please try to help me keep up these habits. I put a calendar on the door to my room in my house, and it will have markings for each of the habits.
