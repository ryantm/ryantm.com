WordPress has always respected the importance of your writing with auto-save, and now we&#8217;re taking that to another level by allowing you to view who made what changes when to any post or page through a super-easy interface, much like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia&#038;action=history">Wikipedia</a> or a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Subversion">version control system</a>.</p>\n<p><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2008/07/diff.gif" alt="Differences between two versions of posts." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3" /></p>\n<p>This is handy on any blog in case you make a mistake and want to go back to an older version of a post, and it&#8217;s super handy for multi-author blogs where you can see every change tracked by person.</p>\n<h3>Press This!: Post from wherever you are on the web</h3>\n<p>A few months ago on my blog we <a href="http://ma.tt/2008/05/favorite-posting-bookmarklet/">started a conversation about the posting bookmarklet</a> in WordPress and which systems we should look to for inspiration, like Flock, FriendFeed, Facebook, Tumblr, and Delicious. From these suggestions and the Quick Post plugin by Josh Kenzer, we developed a Press This bookmark you can add to your toolbar that provides a fast and smart popup to do posts to your WordPress blog:</p>\n<p><img src="http://wpdotorg.wordpress.com/files/2008/07/press-this.gif" alt="Screenshot of Press This interface." title="press-this" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4" /></p>\n<p>For example, if you click &#8220;Press This&#8221; from a <a href="http://youtube.com/">Youtube</a> page it&#8217;ll magically extract the video embed code, and if you do it from a <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> page it&#8217;ll make it easy for you to put the image in your post. On my blog I&#8217;ve been experimenting with using different categories and the <code>in_category()</code> function &#8212; such as video, quote, aside, et cetera &#8212; to create a more tumblelog-like format.</p>\n<h3>Shift Gears: Turbo-speed your blogging</h3>\n<p><a href="http://gears.google.com/">Gears</a> is an open source browser extension project started by Google that developers like us can use to give you features we wouldn&#8217;t normally be able to. There are a lot of things we can do with Gears in the future, but in this release we&#8217;ve stuck to using what&#8217;s called a &#8220;Local Server&#8221; to cache or keep a copy of commonly-used Javascript and CSS files on your computer, which can speed up the loading of some pages by several seconds (they just pop right up!). You can install Gears for Firefox or Internet Explorer, with support for Safari and Opera pending. WordPress works just fine without it, you just get a little extra juice when you have it installed.</p>\n<h3>Theme Previews: See it before your audience does</h3>\n<p>Now when you select a theme it pops up a window that shows the theme live with all your content, instead of immediately making it active on your site. This is great for just test driving themes before making a switch over publicly, and it is also helpful when you are developing a theme and need to test it but don&#8217;t want everybody to see your ongoing <del datetime="2008-07-14T21:23:41+00:00">mistakes</del> development.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the smaller features and improvements in 2.6:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Word count!</strong> Never guess how many words are in your post anymore.</li>\n<li><strong>Image captions</strong>, so you can add sweet captions <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/">like Political Ticker does</a> under your images.</li>\n<li><strong>Bulk management</strong> of plugins.</li>\n<li>A completely <strong>revamped image control</strong> to allow for easier inserting, floating, and resizing.

In addition to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/">core commit team</a> we had contributions from <a href="http://dd32.id.au/">Dion Hulse</a>, <a href="http://www.ilfilosofo.com/">Austin Matzko</a>, <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/">Otto42</a>, <a href="http://extralogical.net/">Benedict Eastaugh</a>, and <a href="http://www.freecharity.org.uk/">pishmishy</a>. <a href="http://xavisys.com/">AaronCampbell</a> and <a href="http://www.marcozehe.de/">Marco Zehe</a> provided more than a few patches. Back among the top code contributors is <a href="http://www.santosj.name/">Jacob Santos</a>. <a href="http://www.buayacorp.com/">Alex Concha</a> continues to have WordPress&#8217; back. Joining bug reporting and gardening elite are <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Hakre">hakre</a>, <a href="http://www.simonwheatley.co.uk/">Simon Wheatley</a>, mtekk, and <a href="http://www.prescriber.org.uk/">Matty Rob</a>. Finally, congratulations to our <a href="http://westi.wordpress.com/">Peter Westwood</a> on your recent wedding! I&#8217;m also proud to announce we&#8217;re adding a new core committer to the team: Andrew Ozz (azaozz) has been a huge help to the core team this year, particularly around TinyMCE and making the WYSIWYG something that works for you, not against you.</p>\n<p>Because of the new capabilities to make WordPress a clean SVN checkout, plugin and theme authors should do their best to handle forms and posts through WP rather than trying to post to their files directly, here&#8217;s a quick Codex article about <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Handling_POST_and_AJAX_Requests">how to do it using our forward-compatible APIs</a>.</p>\n<h3>Upgrading</h3>\n<p>2.6 is pretty much identical to 2.5 from a plugin and theme compatibility point of view, so upgrades from 2.5 should be pretty painless. The 2.5 branch will no longer be maintain so everyone is encouraged to upgrade. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">Our standard 3-step upgrade instructions apply to this release</a>. There were at least 1,984,047 downloads of the 2.5 series, the fastest growing release we&#8217;ve ever had, and I think all of those people will find 2.6 adds a level of polish that really makes WP a pleasure to use every day. (At least I do. :))</p>\n<h3>Easter Egg</h3>\n<p>There have been rumors and allegations that there was a so-called &#8220;easter egg&#8221; added to 2.6 early in its development. These rumors and allegations are completely false!</p>\n<p>P.S.

The improvements in 2.5 are numerous, and almost entirely a result of your feedback: multi-file uploading, one-click plugin upgrades, built-in galleries, customizable dashboard, salted passwords and cookie encryption, media library, a WYSIWYG that doesn&#8217;t mess with your code, concurrent post editing protection, full-screen writing, and search that covers posts <em>and</em> pages.</p>\n<p>For a short overview of the features with screenshots, it&#8217;d be best to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/">visit our sneak peek announcement for RC1</a>. Or check out <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/">a 4-minute screencast of the new interface in action</a>. If you just want to jump straight to the good stuff <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">here&#8217;s where you can find 2.5 upgrade and download information</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to see everything I would grab a cup of coffee or a mojito, because this post is epic.</p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<p><strong>Cleaner, faster, less cluttered dashboard</strong> &#8212; we&#8217;ve worked hard to take your feedback about what&#8217;s most important in the dashboard and organize things to allow you to focus on what&#8217;s important &#8212; your blog &#8212; and get out of your way. In collaboration with <a href="http://happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a> and the community  we&#8217;ve taken the first major step forward in the WordPress interface since version 1.5.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashboard Widgets</strong> &#8212; the dashboard home page is now a series of widgets, including ones to show you fun stats about your posting, latest comments, people linking to you, new and popular plugins, and of course WordPress news. You can customize any of the dashboard widgets to show, for example, news from your local paper instead of WP news. Plugins can also hook in, for example the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">WordPress.com stats widget</a> adds a handy double-wide stats box.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/stats-widget.png" alt="" width="690" /></p>\n<p><strong>Multi-file upload with progress bar</strong> &#8212; before when you would upload a large file you&#8217;d wait forever, never knowing how far along it was. And uploading more than one photo was an exercise in patience, as you could only do one at a time. Now you can select a whole of folder images or music or videos at once and it&#8217;ll show you the progress of each upload.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus: EXIF extraction</strong> &#8212; if you upload JPEG files with EXIF metadata like camera make and model, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, et al. WordPress will extract all the data into custom fields you can use in your template. If you use the EXIF title fields or similar those will be put into their equivalent fields in WP. Most modern digital cameras generate EXIF data.</p>\n<p><strong>Search posts and pages</strong> &#8212; search used to cover just posts, now it includes pages too, a great boon for those using WordPress as a CMS. New themes can style or sort pages differently in results.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag management</strong> &#8212; you can now add, rename, delete, and do whatever else you like to tags from inside WordPress, no plugins needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Password strength meter</strong> &#8212; when you change your password on your profile it&#8217;ll tell you how strong your password is to help you pick a good one.</p>\n<p><strong>Concurrent editing protection</strong> &#8212; for those of you on multi-author blogs, have you ever opened a post while someone was already editing it, and your auto-saves kept overwriting each other, irrecoverably losing hours of work? I bet that added a few words to your vocabulary. Now if you open a post that someone else is editing, WordPress magically locks it and prevents you from saving until the other person is done. You&#8217;ll see a message like below.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/write-currently-editing.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p><strong>Few-click plugin upgrades</strong> &#8212; if the plugins you use are part of the plugin directory since 2.3 we&#8217;ve told you when they have an update available. Now we take that to the next logical step &#8212; downloading and installing the upgrade for you. This is dependent a little bit on your host setup, and it may ask you for your FTP password much like OS X or Windows will ask you for a password, but it works well on majority of hosts we were able to test, your mileage may very, plugins in mirror may be larger than they appear.</p>\n<p><strong>Friendlier visual post editor</strong> &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure how to articulate this improvement except to say &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t mess with your code anymore.&#8221; We&#8217;re now using version 3.0 of TinyMCE, which means better compatibility with Safari, and we&#8217;ve paid particular attention this release to its integration and interaction with complex HTML. It also now has a &#8220;no-distractions&#8221; mode which is like Writeroom for your browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Built-in galleries</strong> &#8212; when you take advantage of multi-file upload to upload a bunch of photos, we have a new shortcode that lets you to easily embed galleries by just putting [ gallery] (without the space) in your post. It&#8217;ll display all your thumbnails and captions and each will link each to a page where people can comment on the individual photos. I&#8217;ve been using this feature on my blog and have already uploaded over <a href="http://ma.tt/category/gallery/">1,200 pictures into 23 galleries</a>. The shortcode has some hidden options too, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode">check out this documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>Now for the geeky stuff. While we&#8217;re excited about the above features, each one represents a new opportunity or API for other developers to take to another level. (The best of which we&#8217;ll someday integrate back into WP.)</p>\n<p><strong>Salted passwords</strong> &#8212; we now use the <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">phpass</a> library to stretch and salt all passwords stored in the database, which makes brute-forcing them impractical. If you use something like <a href="http://modauthmysql.sourceforge.net/">mod_auth_mysql</a> we&#8217;ve <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/md5-password-hashes/">created a plugin that will allow you to use legacy MD5 hashing</a>. (The hashing is completely pluggable.) Users will automatically switch to the more secure passwords next time they log in.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure cookies</strong> &#8212; cookies are now encrypted based on the protocol described <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf">in this PDF paper</a>. which is something like <code>user name|expiration time|HMAC( user name|expiration time, k)</code> where <code>k = HMAC(user name|expiration time, sk)</code> and where <code>sk</code> is a secret key, which you can define in your config.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy taxonomy and URL creation</strong> &#8212; probably best illustrated with an example: I can call <code>register_taxonomy()</code> with <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/6357/taxes.php">a few arguments</a> to register a &#8220;people&#8221; taxonomy and whenever I edit an image I&#8217;ll see a UI like tags has for identifying the people in a photo, and these will be URL addressable with <code>/person/firstname-lastname/</code>. All with a single function call.</p>\n<p><strong>Inline documentation</strong> &#8212; the vast majority of the new code going into WordPress include inline documentation that explains the functions and documents their arguments.</p>\n<p><strong>Database optimization</strong> &#8212; we haven&#8217;t changed the table layout in this release, which is one of the reasons so many plugins work fine with 2.5. We have added a few new indicies and made a few default fields more flexible based on some bottlenecks we found on WordPress.com, which now hosts 2.7 million WordPress blogs. It should be invisible to the application, just a bit faster on the database side.</p>\n<p><strong>$wpdb->prepare()</strong> &#8212; now almost all of the SQL in WordPress is prepared first, and the same functions are available to your plugins. This should prevent elementary SQL escaping issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Media buttons</strong> &#8212; the add media buttons above the post are both expandable, so you could have an &#8220;Add Google Map&#8221; button if you like, They can be overridden, so if you think you can do the video or audio tab better than we have you can replace the default.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode API</strong> &#8212; the new gallery functionality is powered by the new shortcode API. Shortcodes are little bracket-delineated strings that can be magically expanded at runtime to something more interesting. They give users a short, easy to type and copy/paste string they can move around their post without worrying about messing up complex HTML or embed codes. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API">The Shortcode API is fully documented</a>.</p>\n<p>Now you see why 2.5 took a little extra time. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n<h3>Upgrade Notes</h3>\n<p>2.5 does include security fixes so it is recommended for all users, the 2.3 branch will no longer be updated. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">The upgrade instructions for this version are pretty much the same as any other version</a>. The most important thing to check is your plugins, so if for example everything works except the new uploader, a legacy plugin might be causing a javascript error on the page and breaking it.

The improvements in 2.5 are numerous, and almost entirely a result of your feedback: multi-file uploading, one-click plugin upgrades, built-in galleries, customizable dashboard, salted passwords and cookie encryption, media library, a WYSIWYG that doesn&#8217;t mess with your code, concurrent post editing protection, full-screen writing, and search that covers posts <em>and</em> pages.</p>\n<p>For a short overview of the features with screenshots, it&#8217;d be best to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/">visit our sneak peek announcement for RC1</a>. Or check out <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/">a 4-minute screencast of the new interface in action</a>. If you just want to jump straight to the good stuff <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">here&#8217;s where you can find 2.5 upgrade and download information</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to see everything I would grab a cup of coffee or a mojito, because this post is epic.</p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<p><strong>Cleaner, faster, less cluttered dashboard</strong> &#8212; we&#8217;ve worked hard to take your feedback about what&#8217;s most important in the dashboard and organize things to allow you to focus on what&#8217;s important &#8212; your blog &#8212; and get out of your way. In collaboration with <a href="http://happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a> and the community  we&#8217;ve taken the first major step forward in the WordPress interface since version 1.5.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashboard Widgets</strong> &#8212; the dashboard home page is now a series of widgets, including ones to show you fun stats about your posting, latest comments, people linking to you, new and popular plugins, and of course WordPress news. You can customize any of the dashboard widgets to show, for example, news from your local paper instead of WP news. Plugins can also hook in, for example the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">WordPress.com stats widget</a> adds a handy double-wide stats box.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/stats-widget.png" alt="" width="690" /></p>\n<p><strong>Multi-file upload with progress bar</strong> &#8212; before when you would upload a large file you&#8217;d wait forever, never knowing how far along it was. And uploading more than one photo was an exercise in patience, as you could only do one at a time. Now you can select a whole of folder images or music or videos at once and it&#8217;ll show you the progress of each upload.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus: EXIF extraction</strong> &#8212; if you upload JPEG files with EXIF metadata like camera make and model, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, et al. WordPress will extract all the data into custom fields you can use in your template. If you use the EXIF title fields or similar those will be put into their equivalent fields in WP. Most modern digital cameras generate EXIF data.</p>\n<p><strong>Search posts and pages</strong> &#8212; search used to cover just posts, now it includes pages too, a great boon for those using WordPress as a CMS. New themes can style or sort pages differently in results.</p>\n<p><strong>Tag management</strong> &#8212; you can now add, rename, delete, and do whatever else you like to tags from inside WordPress, no plugins needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Password strength meter</strong> &#8212; when you change your password on your profile it&#8217;ll tell you how strong your password is to help you pick a good one.</p>\n<p><strong>Concurrent editing protection</strong> &#8212; for those of you on multi-author blogs, have you ever opened a post while someone was already editing it, and your auto-saves kept overwriting each other, irrecoverably losing hours of work? I bet that added a few words to your vocabulary. Now if you open a post that someone else is editing, WordPress magically locks it and prevents you from saving until the other person is done. You&#8217;ll see a message like below.</p>\n<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/screenshots/2.5/write-currently-editing.png" alt="" /></p>\n<p><strong>Few-click plugin upgrades</strong> &#8212; if the plugins you use are part of the plugin directory since 2.3 we&#8217;ve told you when they have an update available. Now we take that to the next logical step &#8212; downloading and installing the upgrade for you. This is dependent a little bit on your host setup, and it may ask you for your FTP password much like OS X or Windows will ask you for a password, but it works well on majority of hosts we were able to test, your mileage may very, plugins in mirror may be larger than they appear.</p>\n<p><strong>Friendlier visual post editor</strong> &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure how to articulate this improvement except to say &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t mess with your code anymore.&#8221; We&#8217;re now using version 3.0 of TinyMCE, which means better compatibility with Safari, and we&#8217;ve paid particular attention this release to its integration and interaction with complex HTML. It also now has a &#8220;no-distractions&#8221; mode which is like Writeroom for your browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Built-in galleries</strong> &#8212; when you take advantage of multi-file upload to upload a bunch of photos, we have a new shortcode that lets you to easily embed galleries by just putting [ gallery] (without the space) in your post. It&#8217;ll display all your thumbnails and captions and each will link each to a page where people can comment on the individual photos. I&#8217;ve been using this feature on my blog and have already uploaded over <a href="http://ma.tt/category/gallery/">1,200 pictures into 23 galleries</a>. The shortcode has some hidden options too, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode">check out this documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>Now for the geeky stuff. While we&#8217;re excited about the above features, each one represents a new opportunity or API for other developers to take to another level. (The best of which we&#8217;ll someday integrate back into WP.)</p>\n<p><strong>Salted passwords</strong> &#8212; we now use the <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">phpass</a> library to stretch and salt all passwords stored in the database, which makes brute-forcing them impractical. If you use something like <a href="http://modauthmysql.sourceforge.net/">mod_auth_mysql</a> we&#8217;ve <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/md5-password-hashes/">created a plugin that will allow you to use legacy MD5 hashing</a>. (The hashing is completely pluggable.) Users will automatically switch to the more secure passwords next time they log in.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure cookies</strong> &#8212; cookies are now encrypted based on the protocol described <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf">in this PDF paper</a>. which is something like <code>user name|expiration time|HMAC( user name|expiration time, k)</code> where <code>k = HMAC(user name|expiration time, sk)</code> and where <code>sk</code> is a secret key, which you can define in your config.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy taxonomy and URL creation</strong> &#8212; probably best illustrated with an example: I can call <code>register_taxonomy()</code> with <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/6357/taxes.php">a few arguments</a> to register a &#8220;people&#8221; taxonomy and whenever I edit an image I&#8217;ll see a UI like tags has for identifying the people in a photo, and these will be URL addressable with <code>/person/firstname-lastname/</code>. All with a single function call.</p>\n<p><strong>Inline documentation</strong> &#8212; the vast majority of the new code going into WordPress include inline documentation that explains the functions and documents their arguments.</p>\n<p><strong>Database optimization</strong> &#8212; we haven&#8217;t changed the table layout in this release, which is one of the reasons so many plugins work fine with 2.5. We have added a few new indicies and made a few default fields more flexible based on some bottlenecks we found on WordPress.com, which now hosts 2.7 million WordPress blogs. It should be invisible to the application, just a bit faster on the database side.</p>\n<p><strong>$wpdb->prepare()</strong> &#8212; now almost all of the SQL in WordPress is prepared first, and the same functions are available to your plugins. This should prevent elementary SQL escaping issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Media buttons</strong> &#8212; the add media buttons above the post are both expandable, so you could have an &#8220;Add Google Map&#8221; button if you like, They can be overridden, so if you think you can do the video or audio tab better than we have you can replace the default.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode API</strong> &#8212; the new gallery functionality is powered by the new shortcode API. Shortcodes are little bracket-delineated strings that can be magically expanded at runtime to something more interesting. They give users a short, easy to type and copy/paste string they can move around their post without worrying about messing up complex HTML or embed codes. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API">The Shortcode API is fully documented</a>.</p>\n<p>Now you see why 2.5 took a little extra time. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n<h3>Upgrade Notes</h3>\n<p>2.5 does include security fixes so it is recommended for all users, the 2.3 branch will no longer be updated. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">The upgrade instructions for this version are pretty much the same as any other version</a>. The most important thing to check is your plugins, so if for example everything works except the new uploader, a legacy plugin might be causing a javascript error on the page and breaking it. If something goes wrong, the safest thing to do is turn your plugins off (we have a button to do them all at once, now) and turn them back on one-by-one, testing the problem along the way. This has solved almost everybody&#8217;s problems in testing, and it also lets you know which plugin author to show some love to so they&#8217;ll update their plugin, and which plugin authors already have so you can shower them with praises on your blog.</p>\n<p>One brief note about some of the new upload and plugin upgrade features, there are some edge-case hosting platforms, like versions of Lighttpd before 1.5 or over-agressive mod_security rules, which can break. If something isn&#8217;t working like it was looked in the screenshot, ask your host if there&#8217;s something on the server side which may be interfering.

This is mainly a problem if your site allows users to register for a user login, however, I would still recommend this upgrade for all users, just to be on the safe side.</p>\n<p>For those of you who are <acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym>/MySQL developers yourselves, I highly recommend reading Stefan Esser&#8217;s explanation of the <a href="http://www.suspekt.org/2008/08/17/mt_srand-and-not-so-random-numbers/"><acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym> mt_srand() bug</a> and the <a href="http://www.suspekt.org/2008/08/18/mysql-and-sql-column-truncation-vulnerabilities/">MySQL <acronym title="Structured Query Language"><span class="caps">SQL</span></acronym> Column Truncation</a> issue. He provides some really good detail of the problems. Stefan is also the developer of the <a href="http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/"><acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym> Suhosin module</a>, which provides extra security-related features and protections to <acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that these problems don&#8217;t just affect WordPress &#8212; many other <acronym title="Php Hypertext Processor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym>/MySQL applications could be vulnerable to future problems if they don&#8217;t examine and patch their code.</p>";}i:2;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:24:"Matt: SEO Book Interview";s:4:"guid";s:40:"http://ma.tt/2008/09/seo-book-interview/";s:4:"link";s:40:"http://ma.tt/2008/09/seo-book-interview/";s:11:"description";s:261:"<p><a href="http://www.seobook.com/interview-matt-mullenweg-wordpress-and-automattic-fame">A new interview with Aaron Wall of SEO Book up</a>.

Instead, the theme author should update the theme, change the version number and then, the theme repository API should notify the end user within the WordPress administration panel that a new version of their theme is available.

Posting the write-up here with the hope it will be useful.</p>\n<p>The issue is a change in the activity happening in the <code>save_post</code> hook. I&#8217;d probably consider this change in WP to be a bug or regression - but it&#8217;s out there now in 2.6.x, so as plugin developers we have to work around it (even it a better solution is found in a future WP release).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I received a couple of bug reports from people recently that Twitter Tools was creating duplicate custom fields for them. This struck me as odd, as that code hasn&#8217;t changed and it&#8217;s pretty darn simple. Turns out it was WordPress that had changed, and Twitter Tools (and probably many other plugins) now need to adapt.</p>\n<h4>The Problem</h4>\n<p>After publishing a post, future edits to that post would cause additional, duplicate custom fields to be added to the post. Here is an example:</p>\n<p class="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/2831277536/" title="Duplicate Custom Fields by alexkingorg, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3247/2831277536_ac3d03e108_m.jpg" width="222" height="240" alt="Duplicate Custom Fields" /></a></p>\n<h4>The Cause</h4>\n<p>It took be a little while to debug this. The code is simple:</p>\n<div class="code"><code>function aktt_store_post_options($post_id) {<br />\n  [&#8230;]<br />\n  if (!update_post_meta($post_id, &#8216;aktt_notify_twitter&#8217;, $notify)) {<br />\n    add_post_meta($post_id, &#8216;aktt_notify_twitter&#8217;, $notify);<br />\n  }<br />\n}<br />\nadd_action(&#8217;save_post&#8217;, &#8216;aktt_store_post_options&#8217;, 1);</code></div>\n<p>This code fires when a post is saved, and updates the custom fields appropriately.<sup><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/feed?cat=16#fn1220637686015n" id="fn1220637686015" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The <code>aktt_store_post_options</code> function is attached to the <code>save_post</code> hook, so that code is executed when a post is saved.</p>\n<p>The <code>save_post</code> hook actually sends two parameters <code>$post_id</code> (just the ID) and <code>$post</code> (the full post data). I&#8217;d chosen to use just the <code>$post_id</code> parameter here because I only needed to store the post ID along with the custom field key and value.</p>\n<p>This works great on versions of WordPress prior to 2.6, but a new feature in WP 2.6 changed that. The new feature in question is: post revisions.</p>\n<p>With the post revision feature, post revisions are saved along with the post - also triggering the <code>save_post</code> hook. For these, the <code>$post_id</code> (for an already published post) being passed to my function is the id of the post <em>revision</em>, not the original post id.

Posting the write-up here with the hope it will be useful.</p>\n<p>The issue is a change in the activity happening in the <code>save_post</code> hook. I&#8217;d probably consider this change in WP to be a bug or regression - but it&#8217;s out there now in 2.6.x, so as plugin developers we have to work around it (even it a better solution is found in a future WP release).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I received a couple of bug reports from people recently that Twitter Tools was creating duplicate custom fields for them. This struck me as odd, as that code hasn&#8217;t changed and it&#8217;s pretty darn simple. Turns out it was WordPress that had changed, and Twitter Tools (and probably many other plugins) now need to adapt.</p>\n<h4>The Problem</h4>\n<p>After publishing a post, future edits to that post would cause additional, duplicate custom fields to be added to the post. Here is an example:</p>\n<p class="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/2831277536/" title="Duplicate Custom Fields by alexkingorg, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3247/2831277536_ac3d03e108_m.jpg" width="222" height="240" alt="Duplicate Custom Fields" /></a></p>\n<h4>The Cause</h4>\n<p>It took be a little while to debug this. The code is simple:</p>\n<div class="code"><code>function aktt_store_post_options($post_id) {<br />\n  [&#8230;]<br />\n  if (!update_post_meta($post_id, &#8216;aktt_notify_twitter&#8217;, $notify)) {<br />\n    add_post_meta($post_id, &#8216;aktt_notify_twitter&#8217;, $notify);<br />\n  }<br />\n}<br />\nadd_action(&#8217;save_post&#8217;, &#8216;aktt_store_post_options&#8217;, 1);</code></div>\n<p>This code fires when a post is saved, and updates the custom fields appropriately.<sup><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/feed?cat=16#fn1220637686015n" id="fn1220637686015" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The <code>aktt_store_post_options</code> function is attached to the <code>save_post</code> hook, so that code is executed when a post is saved.</p>\n<p>The <code>save_post</code> hook actually sends two parameters <code>$post_id</code> (just the ID) and <code>$post</code> (the full post data). I&#8217;d chosen to use just the <code>$post_id</code> parameter here because I only needed to store the post ID along with the custom field key and value.</p>\n<p>This works great on versions of WordPress prior to 2.6, but a new feature in WP 2.6 changed that. The new feature in question is: post revisions.</p>\n<p>With the post revision feature, post revisions are saved along with the post - also triggering the <code>save_post</code> hook. For these, the <code>$post_id</code> (for an already published post) being passed to my function is the id of the post <em>revision</em>, not the original post id. As a result, my function is checking to see if the newly created revision (not the original post) has this custom field and adding it when it doesn&#8217;t find it.</p>\n<p>WordPress then seems to aggregate the custom fields from all revisions into the display for the post on the Write page in the admin interface. I haven&#8217;t looked into the details of this yet, but that&#8217;s a fair guess. The point is that these custom fields are being added to post id 12, 13, 14, etc. but all being displayed for post id 12.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t what we want.</p>\n<h4>The Solution</h4>\n<p>The solution is to look at the post itself instead of just the post id.

If anyone has any public speaking tips that don&#8217;t involve imagining people in their underwear, let me know. Or, if you have any particular points that you think I should address, I&#8217;d be interested in hearing those, too. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ll be able to discuss everything that everyone wants, and I don&#8217;t claim to have a crystal ball that tells me any more about the timeline of WordPress features than anyone else.

I was in Mobile, Alabama, at the time, having just started <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/" title="Lorelle on WordPress" rel="tag">Lorelle on WordPress</a> on the brand new <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/" title="WordPress.com free blogs" rel="tag">WordPress.com</a> a week or so before the hurricane hit the Gulf Coast, causing destruction over tens of thousands of square miles along the coast and deep into the country. The hurricane&#8217;s storm surge plowed 22 feet of water up the Dog River to where we lived, bringing destruction in it&#8217;s wake and retreat. Tornado force winds ripped out trees and turned them into missiles. Nary a <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/08/28/one-year-anniversary-review-hurricane-katrina/" title="Hurricane Katrina">sign, building, nor person was safe</a> with the winds and the force of the storm surge waters.</p>\n<p>While running from the storm to Atlanta at the last minute when the score <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/05/visual-impact-of-hurricane-katrina/" title="Visual Impact of Hurricane Katrina">turned from Category 4 to Category 5</a>, only to have Katrina follow us and beat us down, causing death and destruction in <a href="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/oceanspringsdamagedhouse.jpg"><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/oceanspringsdamagedhouse.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2933" /></a>Atlanta a few days later, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/08/29/blogs-about-hurricane-katrina/" title="Blogs About Hurricane Katrina">I blogged about many of the first blogs about Hurricane Katrina</a> and about how <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/11/blogging-katrina-upclose-and-personal/" title="Blogging Katrina Up Close and Personal">blogs helped</a> and <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/19/the-blog-rumor-heard-around-the-world-blaming-katrina/" title="The Blog Rumor Heard Around the World - Blaming Katrina">impacted our lives</a> in the <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/23/katrina-katrina-hurricane-katrina-everywhere-you-look/" title="Katrina, Katrina, Hurricane Katrina Everywhere You Look">wake of the storm</a>.

He offers some great tips, including a new one I wished I&#8217;d had during my own disaster experiences. He recommends your site is hosted on the server cloud or grid, which I <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/07/01/lessons-from-ltpact-2008-cloud-servers-and-gambling/" title="Cloud Servers and Gambling">spoke about recently</a>:<br />\n<span id="more-2930"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>3. Move Data to The Cloud</strong></p>\n<p>Any information that you need to run your site, put it in a secure place on the Web. Remember that you will likely be using a strange computer so any URLs that you can’t remember and type by hand, put those on the Web too. If you use a program to store your passwords, store a cache of those on the Web also. Obviously, you’ll want to encrypt and secure such information before posting it.</p>\n<p>Even if you have your own browser on a thumb drive, as recommended above, it is best to make sure everything is in multiple places. I have been repeatedly saved by my private bookmarks on Diigo.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today, we have more resources for backups and protecting our site, so take advantage of them now in safe times, as well as for disaster protection and backups. For those with blogs on the cloud or grid and using cache Plugins and the latest version of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" title="WordPress" rel="tag">WordPress</a> with improved cache, their sites could easily flex and withstand the sudden influx of traffic without crashing or breaking bandwidth restrictions. </p>\n<p>In addition to Jonathan&#8217;s tips on blogging a disaster, I&#8217;d add:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring cameras, video, and audio recording equipment to preserve your memories and experiences for uploading to your blog and for your own records.</li>\n<li>Bring more than plenty of all the appropriate batteries for your various equipment. </li>\n<li>Have your blog setup with image, audio, and video uploading WordPress Plugins installed and be familiar with how they work.</li>\n<li>Sign up in advance with video, audio, and image hosting services so you can quickly upload, store, and link to those images from within your blog.</li>\n<li>Backup your evacuation and escape routes. Have at least two backup plans for evacuation and escape, before evacuating and for during the evacuation. Evacuation routes shift as the storm changes its course, and the storm may suddenly change speed, arriving ahead of schedule or behind. Be prepared to move fast and stay long.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Blogs Offer Communication, Information, and Connections During Disasters</h3>\n<p><a href="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/hwy90bridgetoriver.jpg"><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/hwy90bridgetoriver.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2932" /></a>In the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina, blogs served up information and first hand experiences of the wait for the massive hurricane. People provided resources for help, evacuation, and reports on what they were doing to prepare for the hurricane. With the fast and easy set up for a <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" title="WordPress" rel="tag">WordPress</a> blog, and the newly created <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/" title="WordPress.com free blogs" rel="tag">WordPress.com</a> free blog hosting service, many of those Hurricane Katrina blogs were powered by WordPress, as are many blogs with Hurricane Gustav news and reports.</p>\n<p>During the hurricane, a few blogs, typically ones supported by news agencies and the media with generators and situated in defensible and protected locations, kept us up-to-date with the disaster as it happened from their perspective, as did the media in general. </p>\n<p>I remember watching weather reporters hanging onto railings as debris flew all around them, microphones clutched in their white knuckled hands screaming and shouting to be recorded over the strong winds and crashing water sounds. I thought then as I do now, &#8220;We don&#8217;t need to have a blow by blow report <em>that bad</em>. We can wait.&#8221; But the media needed the sensational perspective to keep watchers glued to their televisions and websites for the up-to-the-minute status of the ent. And some bloggers tried to emulate the journalists, putting their lives at risk. </p>\n<p>With uploading and embedding of video with WordPress Plugins like <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/podpress/#post-566" title="PodPress plugin">PodPress</a> as well as the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smart-youtube/" title="Smart YouTube">Smart YouTube</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/" title="NextGEN Gallery">NextGEN Gallery</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tantan-flickr/" title="Flickr Photo Album">Flickr Photo Album</a>, and the popular <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/" title="Viper''s Video Quicktags">Viper&#8217;s Video Quicktags</a>, it&#8217;s fast and simple to add video of all types to your WordPress blog. However, never risk your life for the sake of images for your blog. Leave that to the professionals - whom we hope are better trained and skilled at surviving the hazards mother nature throws their way.</p>\n<p>With debris covering the highways and access points, it took a while for rescue and recovery services to get into many areas, as well as for evacuees to return. For those still connected to the web with generators and satellite or still working cell phones, blogs brought information faster than most news and government agencies. They also spread rumors like wild fire.</p>\n<p>After the hurricane, blogs played a huge role in not only reporting on the activity, but exaggerating it. In my article series <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/11/19/i-want-to-start-a-controversy/" title="I Want To Start a Controversy">on controversies and blogs</a>, I wrote about <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/11/23/finding-conspiracy-blogs-and-the-truth/" title="Finding Conspiracy Blogs…and The Truth">how the events in the New Orleans Astrodome</a> were exaggerated and turned into an urban legend due to a blogger faking the story:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hurricane Katrina brought of a lot conspiracy theories and hoaxes into play, including a huge one which played into the <a href="http://www.snopes.com/katrina/personal/volunteer.asp" title="New Orleans Astrodome myth" rel="tag">New Orleans Astrodome myth</a> in the wake of the disaster. Since it was easy to believe that people will descend into violence and “ugly” at the drop of a social hat, and that the government is useless in such situations, many believed what was reported as an “eye-witness account” instead of looking at all the information before judging. Supposedly eye witness accounts reported on horrors that were later found to be untrue, and there is a lot of confusion over who actually wrote this and whether or not they were even there. Yet, many bloggers continue to point to these as proof of whatever theory they support on what happened in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and the dikes breaking.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We&#8217;ll have to watch out for Gustav scams, but in general, blogs did more good than bad as many bloggers stepped up to help by checking out their neighborhoods and communities and reporting on the status of individual homes and businesses, by helping to connect families and friends separated by the storm, by recruiting and directing volunteers and donations for delivery to the needy all along the Gulf Coast, not just to New Orleans. Bloggers pitched in, reported, helped, and aided others all over the country, including opening their homes up to those in need.</p>\n<p><a href="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/peopleokayhousegone.jpg"><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/peopleokayhousegone.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2939" /></a>Learning from the past, many popular and high traffic blogs jumped up to offer links, resources, and references to help with those confronting or trying to comprehend Hurricane Gustav including <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2008/08/hurricane-gusta.html" title="Hurricane Gustav **Updated** | Geekdad from Wired.com">HGeekdad from Wired.com</a>, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/hurricane_gustav_on_the_web_reference_guide.php" title="A Reference Guide for Our Readers ...">Read/Write/Web</a>, and others.</p>\n<p>Social media in general, including microblogs like Twitter, Friendfeed, and Tumblr, played a huge role in preparation, response, and reaction to Hurricane Gustav.

Those who want to help from outside the impacted areas are learning more about how to integrate multiple media and blog sources into a single aggregator without impinging upon copyrights, creating central clearing houses for news and information. The more we learn about how useful blogs are in a disaster, the more our blogs will improve overall. </p>\n<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2006/08/sig.gif" alt="" /><br />\n<hr />\n<p><font size="-1"><b>Site Search Tags:</b> <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=weather" rel="tag">weather</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=weather+blogs" rel="tag">weather blogs</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=disaster" rel="tag">disaster</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=disaster+reporting" rel="tag">disaster reporting</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=disaster+blogging" rel="tag">disaster blogging</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=hurricane" rel="tag">hurricane</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=hurricane+katrina" rel="tag">hurricane katrina</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=hurricane+gustav" rel="tag">hurricane gustav</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=gustav" rel="tag">gustav</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=katrina" rel="tag">katrina</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=new+orleans" rel="tag">new orleans</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=mississippi" rel="tag">mississippi</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=gulf+coast" rel="tag">gulf coast</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=jonathan+bailey" rel="tag">jonathan bailey</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=plagiarism+today" rel="tag">plagiarism today</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=blog+news" rel="tag">blog news</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=blogging+tips" rel="tag">blogging tips</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=how+to+blog+a+disaster" rel="tag">how to blog a disaster</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=blogging+disasters" rel="tag">blogging disasters</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=blog+news" rel="tag">blog news</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=news" rel="tag">news</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=blogging+the+news" rel="tag">blogging the news</a>, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/index.php?s=blogging+events" rel="tag">blogging events</a> </p>\n<p><a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/feed/" title="Feed on Lorelle on WordPress"><img class="wp-smiley" src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2007/02/rss.png" alt="Feed on Lorelle on WordPress" /></a> <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/feed/" title="Feed on Lorelle on WordPress">Subscribe</a>  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LorelleOnWordPress" title="Feedburner Lorelle on WordPress Feed"><img class="wp-smiley" src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/feedburnericon.gif" alt="Feedburner icon" />Via Feedburner</a>  <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=182399" title="Lorelle on WordPress -

I was in Mobile, Alabama, at the time, having just started <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/" title="Lorelle on WordPress" rel="tag">Lorelle on WordPress</a> on the brand new <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/" title="WordPress.com free blogs" rel="tag">WordPress.com</a> a week or so before the hurricane hit the Gulf Coast, causing destruction over tens of thousands of square miles along the coast and deep into the country. The hurricane&#8217;s storm surge plowed 22 feet of water up the Dog River to where we lived, bringing destruction in it&#8217;s wake and retreat. Tornado force winds ripped out trees and turned them into missiles.

He offers some great tips, including a new one I wished I&#8217;d had during my own disaster experiences. He recommends your site is hosted on the server cloud or grid, which I <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/07/01/lessons-from-ltpact-2008-cloud-servers-and-gambling/" title="Cloud Servers and Gambling">spoke about recently</a>:<br />\n<span id="more-2930"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>3. Move Data to The Cloud</strong></p>\n<p>Any information that you need to run your site, put it in a secure place on the Web. Remember that you will likely be using a strange computer so any URLs that you can’t remember and type by hand, put those on the Web too. If you use a program to store your passwords, store a cache of those on the Web also. Obviously, you’ll want to encrypt and secure such information before posting it.</p>\n<p>Even if you have your own browser on a thumb drive, as recommended above, it is best to make sure everything is in multiple places. I have been repeatedly saved by my private bookmarks on Diigo.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today, we have more resources for backups and protecting our site, so take advantage of them now in safe times, as well as for disaster protection and backups. For those with blogs on the cloud or grid and using cache Plugins and the latest version of <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" title="WordPress" rel="tag">WordPress</a> with improved cache, their sites could easily flex and withstand the sudden influx of traffic without crashing or breaking bandwidth restrictions. </p>\n<p>In addition to Jonathan&#8217;s tips on blogging a disaster, I&#8217;d add:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring cameras, video, and audio recording equipment to preserve your memories and experiences for uploading to your blog and for your own records.</li>\n<li>Bring more than plenty of all the appropriate batteries for your various equipment. </li>\n<li>Have your blog setup with image, audio, and video uploading WordPress Plugins installed and be familiar with how they work.</li>\n<li>Sign up in advance with video, audio, and image hosting services so you can quickly upload, store, and link to those images from within your blog.</li>\n<li>Backup your evacuation and escape routes. Have at least two backup plans for evacuation and escape, before evacuating and for during the evacuation. Evacuation routes shift as the storm changes its course, and the storm may suddenly change speed, arriving ahead of schedule or behind. Be prepared to move fast and stay long.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Blogs Offer Communication, Information, and Connections During Disasters</h3>\n<p><a href="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/hwy90bridgetoriver.jpg"><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/hwy90bridgetoriver.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="" width="300" height="224" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2932" /></a>In the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina, blogs served up information and first hand experiences of the wait for the massive hurricane. People provided resources for help, evacuation, and reports on what they were doing to prepare for the hurricane. With the fast and easy set up for a <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" title="WordPress" rel="tag">WordPress</a> blog, and the newly created <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/" title="WordPress.com free blogs" rel="tag">WordPress.com</a> free blog hosting service, many of those Hurricane Katrina blogs were powered by WordPress, as are many blogs with Hurricane Gustav news and reports.</p>\n<p>During the hurricane, a few blogs, typically ones supported by news agencies and the media with generators and situated in defensible and protected locations, kept us up-to-date with the disaster as it happened from their perspective, as did the media in general. </p>\n<p>I remember watching weather reporters hanging onto railings as debris flew all around them, microphones clutched in their white knuckled hands screaming and shouting to be recorded over the strong winds and crashing water sounds. I thought then as I do now, &#8220;We don&#8217;t need to have a blow by blow report <em>that bad</em>. We can wait.&#8221; But the media needed the sensational perspective to keep watchers glued to their televisions and websites for the up-to-the-minute status of the ent. And some bloggers tried to emulate the journalists, putting their lives at risk. </p>\n<p>With uploading and embedding of video with WordPress Plugins like <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/podpress/#post-566" title="PodPress plugin">PodPress</a> as well as the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smart-youtube/" title="Smart YouTube">Smart YouTube</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/" title="NextGEN Gallery">NextGEN Gallery</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tantan-flickr/" title="Flickr Photo Album">Flickr Photo Album</a>, and the popular <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/" title="Viper''s Video Quicktags">Viper&#8217;s Video Quicktags</a>, it&#8217;s fast and simple to add video of all types to your WordPress blog. However, never risk your life for the sake of images for your blog. Leave that to the professionals - whom we hope are better trained and skilled at surviving the hazards mother nature throws their way.</p>\n<p>With debris covering the highways and access points, it took a while for rescue and recovery services to get into many areas, as well as for evacuees to return. For those still connected to the web with generators and satellite or still working cell phones, blogs brought information faster than most news and government agencies. They also spread rumors like wild fire.</p>\n<p>After the hurricane, blogs played a huge role in not only reporting on the activity, but exaggerating it. In my article series <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/11/19/i-want-to-start-a-controversy/" title="I Want To Start a Controversy">on controversies and blogs</a>, I wrote about <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/11/23/finding-conspiracy-blogs-and-the-truth/" title="Finding Conspiracy Blogs…and The Truth">how the events in the New Orleans Astrodome</a> were exaggerated and turned into an urban legend due to a blogger faking the story:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hurricane Katrina brought of a lot conspiracy theories and hoaxes into play, including a huge one which played into the <a href="http://www.snopes.com/katrina/personal/volunteer.asp" title="New Orleans Astrodome myth" rel="tag">New Orleans Astrodome myth</a> in the wake of the disaster. Since it was easy to believe that people will descend into violence and “ugly” at the drop of a social hat, and that the government is useless in such situations, many believed what was reported as an “eye-witness account” instead of looking at all the information before judging. Supposedly eye witness accounts reported on horrors that were later found to be untrue, and there is a lot of confusion over who actually wrote this and whether or not they were even there. Yet, many bloggers continue to point to these as proof of whatever theory they support on what happened in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and the dikes breaking.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We&#8217;ll have to watch out for Gustav scams, but in general, blogs did more good than bad as many bloggers stepped up to help by checking out their neighborhoods and communities and reporting on the status of individual homes and businesses, by helping to connect families and friends separated by the storm, by recruiting and directing volunteers and donations for delivery to the needy all along the Gulf Coast, not just to New Orleans. Bloggers pitched in, reported, helped, and aided others all over the country, including opening their homes up to those in need.</p>\n<p><a href="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/peopleokayhousegone.jpg"><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/peopleokayhousegone.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="" width="224" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2939" /></a>Learning from the past, many popular and high traffic blogs jumped up to offer links, resources, and references to help with those confronting or trying to comprehend Hurricane Gustav including <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2008/08/hurricane-gusta.html" title="Hurricane Gustav **Updated** | Geekdad from Wired.com">HGeekdad from Wired.com</a>, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/hurricane_gustav_on_the_web_reference_guide.php" title="A Reference Guide for Our Readers ...">Read/Write/Web</a>, and others.</p>\n<p>Social media in general, including microblogs like Twitter, Friendfeed, and Tumblr, played a huge role in preparation, response, and reaction to Hurricane Gustav.

Also keep in mind that WordPress 2.7 should not be used on a live blog as 2.7 is no where near stable. What you see here is not necessarily what you&#8217;ll get. This post will highlight WordPress 2.7 at its current stage of development. Please keep this in mind as you read through the post and make comments. </strong>Also, click on any of the thumbnails to see the full size of the image.</p>\n<h2>Back End User Interface:</h2>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/userinterface.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4042" title="WordPress 2.7 Backend User Interface" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/userinterface-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>\n<p>Right from the get go, you&#8217;ll notice that just about every facet of the dashboard has been changed. There is now a left hand side navigational column. This column is displayed no matter which part of the administration panel you are viewing. From what I have read on the WP-Hackers mailing list, the decision to go with a side column for navigation was to cut down on the amount of vertical scrolling. This will also allow plugin authors more room to use the top navigation column. After using this version of WordPress, I have noticed that I don&#8217;t scroll up or down as much as I used to. One thing worthy of noting is that, when a navigational item contains child elements, clicking on the parent initiates a smooth drop down animation. While this means some elements of the administration area will require an extra mouse click, I don&#8217;t find it to be that big of a deal. I imagine if people raise a ruckus about this, the team may decide to initiate the drop down effect during a mouse over.</p>\n<p>Although this feature was not available in this prototype, each content block within the dashboard contains an edit link. I&#8217;m not sure if these will be drag and drop-able like Widgets but at least you&#8217;ll be able to edit their contents or configure them. Speaking of the dashboard, you&#8217;ll notice in the screenshot that there is a new block labeled QuickPress. QuickPress is a quick and easy way to publish posts. Although in this iteration, it does not give you the chance to attach a category. So far, it seems to me as though QuickPress could serve to be a quick and easy draft manager/creator.</p>\n<p>On the left hand side, we have a box labeled <strong>InBox</strong>. Again, I am not sure what the plans are for this area of the dashboard. Any details for this feature are speculative at this point. However, I think it would be pretty cool if it served as a private messaging area. A simple way to contact other WordPress site administrators. Sure, we could use email or IM to accomplish this goal, but doing it from within WordPress sounds pretty good to me.</p>\n<p>As an aside, the black headers for the various blocks in the dashboard appear more stylish to me versus the light blue colored ones in the current implementation.</p>\n<p>Before we move on, we need to acknowledge the <strong>WordPress admin bar</strong> at the top of the administration area. This bar looks and works similar to the way in which the WordPress.com admin bar works. <strong>My Account</strong> acts as a profile link as it takes you directly to your account profile. <strong>New Post</strong> takes you straight to the <strong>Write Panel</strong> and of course, you can see how many new comments you have in the moderation queue which will take you to the comment management panel when clicked on.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, it is important to notice that some of the naming conventions have changed in terms of navigation. For example, Templates have taken the place of Design. There is also a brand new menu item called Utilities. So far, this link houses the following items: <strong>InBox, Tags, Categories, Link Categories, Users, Import, and Export</strong>. This addition seems pretty logical to me. Instead of clicking on the Management tab where you would then gain access to manage content, there is now a parent navigational menu item called Content. Underneath of this element you&#8217;ll find links for <strong>Posts, Comments, Media Library, Links, and Pages.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had discussions with a few people already about why the change from Design to Template has taken place as I don&#8217;t understand why it has changed. Templates seem like they would be a good fit underneath Design. Now, we have the possibility of Themes showing up underneath Templates.</p>\n<h2>The Write Panel:</h2>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/writepanel1.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4044" title="Write Panel In 2.7" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/writepanel1-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>\n<p>The Write Panel in WordPress 2.7 has gone through an overhaul as well. I think you&#8217;ll really enjoy the fact that drag and drop elements are back. You can now drag elements to the sidebar or to the bottom of the panel. I am thoroughly excited for this element alone. We can now configure the write panel so it is best suited for our needs instead of using a static configuration. There is a cool new tab on the right-hand sidebar called settings.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/writepanelsettings.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4045" title="WordPress 2.7 Write Panel Settings" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/writepanelsettings.png" alt="" width="342" height="119" /></a></p>\n<p>If you click on this tab, you&#8217;ll be able to select which elements are displayed and which ones are hidden. An extra bonus in terms of configuring the write panel! Not only can you configure the layout to your liking, you can even exclude the non used items from showing up. With todays average monitor resolutions being as big as they are, these two changes to the write panel may end the need for vertical scrolling. This was a major complaint with the WordPress 2.5 write panel.</p>\n<p>Here is what the Write Panel looks like with all of the settings turned off:</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/emptywritepanel.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4047" title="WordPress 2.7 Write Panel With Settings Turned Off" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/emptywritepanel-300x137.png" alt="" width="300" height="137" /></a></p>\n<p>One last thing about the write panel that I noticed. Instead of the add media buttons that are present within todays WordPress write panel, this version showcases a single Add Media button. For now, this only supports the addition of images into posts but I imagine the other media functionality will be added before its release.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/stickypost.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4059" title="Stickypost In WordPress 2.7" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/stickypost-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>\n<p>Another item worthy of mentioning is that the <strong>Publish tab</strong> now includes an additional option that will allow you to stick a post to the front page. Subsequent posts will be published underneath of this sticky post until the sticky option item is unchecked.</p>\n<h2>Even More Plugin Goodness:</h2>\n<p>Browsing and installing plugins from the respository looks to become even more convenient now that you can do both from the WordPress back end.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/pluginbrowser.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4049" title="WordPress 2.7 Plugin Browser/Installer" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/pluginbrowser-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress 2.7 essentially brings all of the features of the plugin repository and makes them accessible in the back end. The plugin installation area presents you with a myriad of different ways in which to search the respository for plugins. For example, you can search by <strong>Term, Tag, or Author</strong>. I tested the search function by selecting Term and then looking for WP Ajax Edit Comments which is a plugin written by our own Ronald Huereca. The search was fast but didn&#8217;t show the plugin I searched for as the first result. In fact, the plugin was listed on page four at the bottom. This is a good example as to why the Plugin repository search needs to be improved. There is no reason why a plugin should not be listed as the first result if you type in its exact name into the search field.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/pluginsearch.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4050" title="WordPress 2.7 Plugin Search In Action" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/pluginsearch-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>\n<p>Each search result provides a <strong>version number, rating, description and an install link</strong>. When I clicked on the install link, the detailed plugin information page opened in a Lightbox sort of fashion providing me with a button from which to install from. Clicking the install link from the detailed information page will initiate the download of the plugin. The plugin will automatically be unpacked and installed into WordPress. This is what a successful plugin installation screen looks like in 2.7.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/successfulinstall.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4051" title="Successful Plugin Install" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/successfulinstall-300x162.png" alt="" width="300" height="162" /></a></p>\n<p>If the plugin was installed successfully, the only thing you&#8217;ll have left to do is activate and then configure it.</p>\n<p><span>Although this is great for end users, plugin authors will be pleased to know that they will be able to upload plugins to the repository from the WordPress back end.</span> The Upload Plugin feature in the backend will allow the uploading of plugin archives to your own site while installing them directly from the zip file.

We can thank the team for building a quality plugin repository API for allowing much of this to happen. I have a feeling that the theme repository and the back end of WordPress will end up going down a similar route with a future version of WordPress.</p>\n<h2>More Image Settings:</h2>\n<p>Within the Miscellaneous section of settings, there are now a few more options for customizing the display of images within posts. You can now configure <strong>a large image size, default image size, default image alignment, and default image links</strong>.

Then, add your results to the WordPress <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Plugin_Compatibility/2.7">2.7 Plugin Compatibility page</a> within the Codex.  Note to contributors: Please include the version number of the plugin you tested. This will help both WordPress users and plugin developers determine what needs to be addressed.</p>\n<h2>Make This The Best Release Ever:</h2>\n<p>There are a number of ways in which you can help make this the best release of WordPress thus far. First, there are the mailing lists which you can subscribe and participate in.</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists#Testers">WP-Testers Mailing List</a> - You can download the pre-releases of WordPress and test them, so that the WordPress developers can fix problems before the new version is made available to the public. If you would like to get involved in this effort, join this mailing list, where new releases are announced and discussed.</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists#Hackers">WP-Hackers Mailing List</a> -  All contributions, ideas and suggestions are welcome at the mailing list. Sometimes, requests are also made on the list asking for the help of volunteers to assist in the improvement and development of specific functionality.</p>\n<p>Occasionally there are also bug days on the <strong>#wordpress-bugs</strong> IRC channel. You can read about what happens in a bug day in <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Bug_Hunts">WordPress Bug Hunts</a>, and subscribe to either the wp-hackers or wp-testers mailing list to find out when they happen.</p>\n<p>Also, bookmark this <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.7">Codex page dedicated to WordPress 2.7</a>. It will be updated as the day of release gets closer.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>Considering WordPress 2.5 was released not too long ago, seeing another User Interface design in the administration panel frustrated me a little at first. I was just beginning to get used to the way the 2.5 admin area looks and feels. However, I <em>must</em> admit that the more I use this new design, the more I enjoy using it. There might be a few users who are upset with the left hand navigation column being displayed on every page. I know I was, especially on the Write panel where I felt squeezed in. However, after using the test version for a little while, I am actually starting to appreciate the vertical navigational column as I don&#8217;t need to scroll my mouse wheel up and down as much as I used to. The re-introduction of drag and drop elements within the Write panel is a huge sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>Overall, I really like what I&#8217;ve seen thus far in this very, very early build of WordPress 2.7. There is still a lot of time before 2.7 is released. Things can and probably will change from now until then but as of right now, things are looking really good.</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Tue, 02 Sep 2008 12:15:07 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";}s:7:"summary";s:14986:"<p>Although tentatively scheduled for <a title="http://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/" href="http://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/" target="_blank">November</a>, WordPress 2.7 looks to be as big of a release since WordPress 2.5, perhaps even bigger. <strong>Before reading the rest of this post, please keep in mind that what you see in the following screenshots is by no means a representation of the final product. Also keep in mind that WordPress 2.7 should not be used on a live blog as 2.7 is no where near stable. What you see here is not necessarily what you&#8217;ll get. This post will highlight WordPress 2.7 at its current stage of development. Please keep this in mind as you read through the post and make comments. </strong>Also, click on any of the thumbnails to see the full size of the image.</p>\n<h2>Back End User Interface:</h2>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/userinterface.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4042" title="WordPress 2.7 Backend User Interface" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/userinterface-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>\n<p>Right from the get go, you&#8217;ll notice that just about every facet of the dashboard has been changed. There is now a left hand side navigational column. This column is displayed no matter which part of the administration panel you are viewing. From what I have read on the WP-Hackers mailing list, the decision to go with a side column for navigation was to cut down on the amount of vertical scrolling. This will also allow plugin authors more room to use the top navigation column. After using this version of WordPress, I have noticed that I don&#8217;t scroll up or down as much as I used to. One thing worthy of noting is that, when a navigational item contains child elements, clicking on the parent initiates a smooth drop down animation. While this means some elements of the administration area will require an extra mouse click, I don&#8217;t find it to be that big of a deal. I imagine if people raise a ruckus about this, the team may decide to initiate the drop down effect during a mouse over.</p>\n<p>Although this feature was not available in this prototype, each content block within the dashboard contains an edit link. I&#8217;m not sure if these will be drag and drop-able like Widgets but at least you&#8217;ll be able to edit their contents or configure them. Speaking of the dashboard, you&#8217;ll notice in the screenshot that there is a new block labeled QuickPress. QuickPress is a quick and easy way to publish posts. Although in this iteration, it does not give you the chance to attach a category. So far, it seems to me as though QuickPress could serve to be a quick and easy draft manager/creator.</p>\n<p>On the left hand side, we have a box labeled <strong>InBox</strong>. Again, I am not sure what the plans are for this area of the dashboard. Any details for this feature are speculative at this point. However, I think it would be pretty cool if it served as a private messaging area. A simple way to contact other WordPress site administrators. Sure, we could use email or IM to accomplish this goal, but doing it from within WordPress sounds pretty good to me.</p>\n<p>As an aside, the black headers for the various blocks in the dashboard appear more stylish to me versus the light blue colored ones in the current implementation.</p>\n<p>Before we move on, we need to acknowledge the <strong>WordPress admin bar</strong> at the top of the administration area. This bar looks and works similar to the way in which the WordPress.com admin bar works. <strong>My Account</strong> acts as a profile link as it takes you directly to your account profile. <strong>New Post</strong> takes you straight to the <strong>Write Panel</strong> and of course, you can see how many new comments you have in the moderation queue which will take you to the comment management panel when clicked on.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, it is important to notice that some of the naming conventions have changed in terms of navigation. For example, Templates have taken the place of Design. There is also a brand new menu item called Utilities. So far, this link houses the following items: <strong>InBox, Tags, Categories, Link Categories, Users, Import, and Export</strong>. This addition seems pretty logical to me. Instead of clicking on the Management tab where you would then gain access to manage content, there is now a parent navigational menu item called Content. Underneath of this element you&#8217;ll find links for <strong>Posts, Comments, Media Library, Links, and Pages.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had discussions with a few people already about why the change from Design to Template has taken place as I don&#8217;t understand why it has changed. Templates seem like they would be a good fit underneath Design. Now, we have the possibility of Themes showing up underneath Templates.</p>\n<h2>The Write Panel:</h2>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/writepanel1.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-4044" title="Write Panel In 2.7" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/writepanel1-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>\n<p>The Write Panel in WordPress 2.7 has gone through an overhaul as well. I think you&#8217;ll really enjoy the fact that drag and drop elements are back. You can now drag elements to the sidebar or to the bottom of the panel. I am thoroughly excited for this element alone. We can now configure the write panel so it is best suited for our needs instead of using a static configuration. There is a cool new tab on the right-hand sidebar called settings.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/writepanelsettings.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4045" title="WordPress 2.7 Write Panel Settings" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/writepanelsettings.png" alt="" width="342" height="119" /></a></p>\n<p>If you click on this tab, you&#8217;ll be able to select which elements are displayed and which ones are hidden. An extra bonus in terms of configuring the write panel! Not only can you configure the layout to your liking, you can even exclude the non used items from showing up. With todays average monitor resolutions being as big as they are, these two changes to the write panel may end the need for vertical scrolling. This was a major complaint with the WordPress 2.5 write panel.</p>\n<p>Here is what the Write Panel looks like with all of the settings turned off:</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/emptywritepanel.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4047" title="WordPress 2.7 Write Panel With Settings Turned Off" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/08/emptywritepanel-300x137.png" alt="" width="300" height="137" /></a></p>\n<p>One last thing about the write panel that I noticed.

Unfortunately this affects every blog that uses the plugin in &#8220;ON&#8221; or full &#8220;Super Cache&#8221; mode, and has URLs that end with the &#8220;/&#8221; (forward slash) character. If the plugin is on &#8220;half on&#8221; mode, you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>\n<p>The problem is that an anonymous user might visit a legitimate URL, ending with a slash, the plugin then creates a static file out of that page, which is then used when people visit the same URL. Unfortunately if someone links to that URL without the ending slash, a visiting browser or search engine bot won&#8217;t be redirected to the proper URL, they&#8217;ll be served the static html file. <br clear="all" /></p>\n<p>For example:\n<ol>\n<li> John visits the URL <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2007/05/23/why-the-nurses-cant-go-on-strike/">/2007/05/23/why-the-nurses-cant-go-on-strike/</a> on my site. WP Super Cache creates a html file of that page.</li>\n<li> In his enthusiasm for that post, John publishes a post about those zany doctors, but he forgets the ending &#8220;/&#8221;.</li>\n<li> Googlebot, seeing fresh content on John&#8217;s site, crawls it and sees the link, visits my site eventually and wonders why it&#8217;s seeing the exact same page at two different URLs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To be fair, Google is pretty good at figuring out where duplicate content is supposed to go but it&#8217;s better to avoid the issue completely. It also only matters if there are links to your site without the ending slash.

Unfortunately this affects every blog that uses the plugin in &#8220;ON&#8221; or full &#8220;Super Cache&#8221; mode, and has URLs that end with the &#8220;/&#8221; (forward slash) character. If the plugin is on &#8220;half on&#8221; mode, you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>\n<p>The problem is that an anonymous user might visit a legitimate URL, ending with a slash, the plugin then creates a static file out of that page, which is then used when people visit the same URL. Unfortunately if someone links to that URL without the ending slash, a visiting browser or search engine bot won&#8217;t be redirected to the proper URL, they&#8217;ll be served the static html file. <br clear="all" /></p>\n<p>For example:\n<ol>\n<li> John visits the URL <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2007/05/23/why-the-nurses-cant-go-on-strike/">/2007/05/23/why-the-nurses-cant-go-on-strike/</a> on my site. WP Super Cache creates a html file of that page.</li>\n<li> In his enthusiasm for that post, John publishes a post about those zany doctors, but he forgets the ending &#8220;/&#8221;.</li>\n<li> Googlebot, seeing fresh content on John&#8217;s site, crawls it and sees the link, visits my site eventually and wonders why it&#8217;s seeing the exact same page at two different URLs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To be fair, Google is pretty good at figuring out where duplicate content is supposed to go but it&#8217;s better to avoid the issue completely. It also only matters if there are links to your site without the ending slash. The most common will probably be to your homepage as it&#8217;s likely internal URLs will be copy/pasted.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Fix</strong><br />\nYou should update to version 0.7 of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">plugin</a> which checks if your blog is affected by this problem.

Instead, if the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">plugins</a> or <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/">themes</a> you use are a gift to you (<a href="http://foolswisdom.com/no-free-lunch/">free</a>), blog about, comment on forums, write the authors directly thanking them for the work that you miss because it isn&#8217;t working with the newest version of WordPress. Why wait till there is a problem, thank them today.</p>\n<p>If you really need to blame someone, blame me. I can take it.</p>";}i:48;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:34:"Matt: South Africa: Stormhoek

(30, 3, '2008-04-08 12:10:21', '2008-04-08 18:10:21', 'If you''ve ever used Facebook''s photo application you might have wondered how they make the images go so fast. Since I wanted to have fast viewing of our snapshot galleries over at <a href="http://www.brawlsnapshots.com" title="Brawl Snapshots">Brawl Snapshots</a>, I set out to figure out how to do it.\r\n\r\nThe main component of a fast gallery is caching. By telling the browser to load images in hidden divs before they are actually displayed to the user, the browser cache is primed for the quick switch.\r\n\r\nThe way you request these images in the background is the meat of the problem and the solution depends on what you are trying to do. With Facebook, each gallery has a limited number of photos in it, so Facebook loads all of the imag URLs, comments, and other meta data when you look at the first photo in the gallery. In the case of <a href="http://www.brawlsnapshots.com" title="Brawl Snapshots">Brawl Snapshots</a> this approach wouldn''t work because some of our galleries have over 4000 images in them. Loading and rendering the meta-data for 4000 images just to view one would be a little wasteful.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.ryantm.com/images/fast-gallery-requests.png">\r\n<img src="http://www.ryantm.com/images/fast-gallery-requests.png" alt="Firebug shows AJAX requests from visiting one image" height="61" width="522" /> Fig 1: Firebug shows AJAX requests from visiting one image</a>\r\n\r\nSo instead of loading all the data up front I opted to use some AJAX requests to populate my cache as needed. When you go to a image in the Brawl Snapshot Gallery, it first loads the image you are on then it uses AJAX to asynchronously load the next and previous image in the background. After those finish we load the next''s next and previous''s previous image as well (see figure 1). This gives our viewers a buffer of two really quick images, which gives us ample time to load some more for all but the quickest users.\r\n\r\nTime to get into the code, most of our fast gallery implementation is available at <a href="http://www.brawlsnapshots.com/javascripts/fast.js" title="Fast Javascript Gallery">http://www.brawlsnapshots.com/javascripts/fast.js</a>. I will try to explain the essential components.\r\n<h3>1. The Populator (populates the cache when needed)</h3>\r\n<pre>window.onload = function() {\r\nif (YAHOO.env.ua.ie || YAHOO.env.ua.gecko || YAHOO.env.ua.webkit)\r\nsetInterval(populate, 200);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction populate() {\r\n  var items = $(''items'');\r\n  if (needsNext() &amp;&amp; gettingMoreNext == false) {\r\n    id = lastObject(items).id;\r\n    gettingMoreNext = true;\r\n    new Ajax.Request(''/snapshots/''+id+''/next?''+queryString, {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:''get''});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if (needsPrevious() &amp;&amp; gettingMorePrevious == false) {\r\n    id = firstObject(items).id\r\n    gettingMorePrevious = true;\r\n    new Ajax.Request(''/snapshots/''+id+''/previous?''+queryString, {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:''get''});\r\n  }\r\n}</pre>\r\nI set the populate function to run every 200 milliseconds with the setInterval() function. Inside the populate function we test if we need to get more, or if we are already getting more snapshot pages. If we aren''t then we launch an AJAX request to get more. When the AJAX requests return the scripts inside them are automatically evaluated. The code on the server side looks like this:\r\n<pre>def previous\r\n  item_parial = render_to_string(:partial=&gt;"snapshots/show", :locals=&gt;{:snapshot=&gt;@snapshot}\r\n  render :update do |page|\r\n    page.insert_html :top, ''items'', item_partial\r\n    page &lt;&lt; "newStuff(''previous'');"\r\n  end\r\nend</pre>\r\nWhat this does is push the new snapshot into the top of the #items div, and then notify our page that it worked by called newStuff. Previous pushes onto the top of the #items div, and Next pushes onto the bottom of the #items div. This orientation is important because it lets us navigate through the cache later.\r\n<h3>The Navigator</h3>\r\nIf you''ve followed these rough steps and modified them for your needs, you should have a list of divs inside an #items div that are in gallery order. Now you want to navigate through them using Javascript. To do this we have to make use of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/history/" title="Yahoo! UI Library: Browser History Manager">Yahoo! UI Library: Browser History Manager</a> which will give you cross browser history and make the back button work. Without this library it is very hard to make the back button work on a Javascript navigated gallery. Luckily Yahoo lets you only include the parts of its libraries upon which Browser History Manager Depends:\r\n<pre>  &lt;script src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.1/build/yahoo/yahoo.js"&gt;\r\n  &lt;script src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.1/build/event/event.js"&gt;\r\n  &lt;script src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.1/build/history/history.js"&gt;\r\n  &lt;iframe id="yui-history-iframe"&gt;\r\n  &lt;input id="yui-history-field" type="hidden" /&gt;</pre>\r\nThis code only needs to be included once for your gallery viewer, not for each item. Now let''s look at the top of the fast.js file where we do some more history initializations\r\n<pre>function stateChange(state) {\r\n  if (ignoreOneChange) {\r\n    ignoreOneChange = false;\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n  var ar = state.split("/");\r\n  var our_id = "";\r\n\r\n  for(piece in ar)\r\n    if (ar[piece].indexOf &amp;&amp; ar[piece].indexOf("?") != -1)\r\n      our_id = ar[piece].split(''?'')[0];\r\n\r\n  toElm = document.getElementById(our_id);\r\n  if (toElm)\r\n    itemTo(document.getElementById(our_id),false);\r\n  else\r\n    window.location = state\r\n}\r\n\r\nYAHOO.util.History.register("items", window.location.toString(), stateChange);\r\nYAHOO.util.History.initialize("yui-history-field", "yui-history-iframe");\r\n\r\nvar bookmarkedState = YAHOO.util.History.getBookmarkedState(''items'');\r\nif (bookmarkedState != null)\r\n  window.location = bookmarkedState;</pre>\r\nstateChange is a function that I register with the history manager to be called every time the browser''s location changes. The purpose of stateChange is synchronize the state of the browser with the history, so this is why if the requested spot in history is in the current cache we immediately jump to that image, otherwise we have to tell that page to load with window.location. Then I make sure there is no current bookmarkedState. If someone were to bookmark an AJAX snapshot with ID 30 the URL might look something like: http://bs.com/snapshots/10#/snapshots/30 so you can see why you might want to revert this to http://bs.com/snapshots/30. You need to do this since web servers are not sent any part of the URL after the octothorpe(#) you would end up at snapshot 10 when you wanted to be at snapshot 30.\r\n\r\nThe last thing to cover is how to insert something into the history. Basically whenever we click a Next link we run some javascript. In this case we run nextItem(), which calls updateURL if it is successful.\r\n<pre>function updateUrl() {\r\n  var newState = "/snapshots/"+currentItem.id+"?"+queryString;\r\n  if ($(''yui-history-iframe''))\r\n    $(''yui-history-iframe'').contentWindow.document.title = document.title;\r\n  YAHOO.util.History.navigate("items", newState);\r\n}</pre>\r\nThis tells the history manager to navigate to the new state. We also set the title of the iframe here so that the history in Internet Explorer contains the page titles. When the url is updated we need to make sure that the title of the page is updated as well. In order to do this I have an element inside each item div that contains the title it should be, and then I look it up to put as the document title when that snapshot is viewed.\r\n\r\nWell that about sums up everything I learned about fast galleries.

I''ve always focused on reading programming and entrepreneurial books before. I''ve realized though that if I want to get serious about supporting myself through my own businesses I have to learn how to market, because as Jantsch says, "every business is actually a marketing business." (pg xi) <br /><br />My plan as I know it so far:<br /><br />If I want to eat food, I need to convince other people to give me money. People only exchange money for value, so I need to show them how my business is valuable to them. If I just make something that is valuable, it''s not good enough, because noone will know that I''ve made it and they will think whatever I''ve made is generic crap. That''s why I need to market what I''ve made.

(15, 3, '2007-06-15 19:54:00', '2007-06-16 01:54:00', 'Recently someone posted on The MUD Connector about having problems with their host. I offered the suggestion of using a non-mud-host specific hosting provider to run a mud, like I do on Deimos MUD. (quarkmud.com 6666) Here is a tutorial for doing it yourself.<br /><br />Obtain an account on bluehost. (www.bluehost.com)<br /><br />Click sign up now. Enter domain name: www.yourMUD.com/org whatever you want. I personally recommend you add domain privacy with Bluehost.<br /><br />Enter all of your information about select that you are going to pay for 24 months right away.<br /><br />now you are thinking: woah why is he saying to go for 2 years right away, right? Here''s why: It only costs $166.80 for 2 years! Plus Bluehost has a great money back guarantee if you don''t like their service. So if you 1 year from now you decide that your MUD isn''t going to exist anymore you just ask for a refund. Also, they throw in the free domain name, which is valued at $10 so that''s great as well.<br /><br />Now comes the slightly hard part. You have to get shell access. This involves proving you are a citizen of the USA. If you aren''t citizen of the USA, sorry. To do this you need to email them a copy of your drivers license or passport. The info on it should match up with the info you entered above. I''m not exactly sure where to email this to, so just call Bluehost (The number is on their website frontpage) and ask them what to do. They are fairly helpful.<br /><br />Okay now you have shell access. This tutorial isn''t really how to set up a new MUD but more to move your MUD to Bluehost. I might do a later tutorial about how to set up a new MUD if people are really interested.<br /><br />Presumably you have the files of your other mud somewhere on another shell. If this is the case do:<br /><pre><br />scp your-user@otherhost.com:~/path/to/mud/ your-user@yourMUD.com:~/mud/<br /></pre><br />That could take a while to finish because your MUD probably has a crapload files. If your MUD has a MySQL database instead, you''ll still be okay. You just dump your database on your host and then upload it into the MySQL database on Bluehost (which you can create really easily with the Bluehost cPanel)<br /><br />There are many other ways to get the files onto the server and I can''t cover them all, but some include FTP, RSync, and Subversion.<br /><br />Okay now that this is done you need to compile your MUD on Bluehost. This could be more difficult than your previous MUD host. For instance, my circleMUD would compile fine on the old gcc that Wolfpaw was using, but Bluehost has a much newer GCC so I got a whole bunch of warnings and errors. The best way to fix these is to just go error by error, then warning by warning, until they are all fixed. After I fixed them all my MUD compiled okay. And I was able to run it. After it was running I could connect to it with:<br /><pre><br />telnet quarkmud.com 6666<br /></pre><br />you''d just substitute your domain name and port there.<br /><br />One last thing you should know is that sometimes Bluehost kills processes that have been running for a really long time. If this happens you want your MUD to come back up in a reasonable time. You cannot solve this the traditional MUD way of just having an autorun script that is constantly running. Instead you have to use a cron job. You can make the cron job using the cPanel interface again. It is best to make a script that will be run to check if your MUD is still running. Here is my script for doing so:<br /><br /><pre><br />#<br />#~/persistent_processes.sh<br /><br />#DeimosMUD<br />DM=`ps ex | grep circle`<br />if [ -z "$DM" ]; then<br />  echo "Restarting DeimosMUD"<br />  cd /home/your-user-name/mud/<br />  ./bin/circle 6666 &<br />fi<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />Make sure the file is executable with:<br /><pre><br />chmod +x persistent_processes.sh<br /></pre><br /><br />This checks if there is a process running that contains the word ''circle.'' If there is not, it restarts the server using the proper shell command to restart the server. I set this script to run every minute using the cron task. To do this go to "Cron Jobs" on the cPanel and then select "Advanced Unix Style." Then fill all of the boxes on the left in with asterisks and type the path to the file you saved above. The path should be something like "/home/your-user/persistent_processes.sh". <br /><br />There you have it, now you have a stable MUD running for a good price.<br /><br />Performance Note:<br /><br />My performance on Bluehost has been better than Wolfpaw.

Ever since when my alarm goes off I''ve been jolting myself out of bed. I am working to build this habit. I did not follow his advice of practicing because I didn''t feel that I needed it. I was correct.<br /><br />This new behavior has had some benefits already. I feel more productive in the early morning, and I also feel less tired. I am definitely going to practice this next semester at school. A lot of times last year I would sleep in and laze away the morning. This always ended up making me more tired.<br /><br />I''m also contemplating starting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">polyphasic sleep schedule.</a> It sounds like a lot of fun to try it because it changes your whole perspective on time. The main reason that Steve Pavlina stopped doing polyphasic sleep, after doing it for a year, was that he felt like he was spending less time with his wife. Even though he was with her the same amount of time, it felt like less, because she was only up for 2/3 of the time he was. I don''t have this problem so maybe it will be easier to implement. If I form a relationship while on this schedule I will already have the expectation of how much time to spend with that person.<br /><br />Some ideas I have to combat loneliness are to start a IRC chatroom for polyphasic sleepers, and to start a group that talks about problems they face, and how we can attempt to convert more people to the schedule.

I''m going to take a look at nuclear waste generation so that you can get a better feel for the issue.<br /><br />Yesterday I received <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.ameren.com/AboutUs/ADC_AmerenLinesAmerenIP_Jan2008.pdf">this document</a> in the mail with my power bill. The second page contained these charts:<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_kIdEgOAP3dM/R6R6uoQDkDI/AAAAAAAAAAM/AWy3hbovAnc/s1600-h/ameren.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_kIdEgOAP3dM/R6R6uoQDkDI/AAAAAAAAAAM/AWy3hbovAnc/s400/ameren.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5162386014370762802" border="0" /></a>This made me want to calculate the upper bound of my household''s Nuclear Waste production. The reason I say ''upper bound'' is because the values for nuclear waste generation are just given as an upper bound on how much waste per 1000 kilowatt-hours produced. The actual nuclear waste generation might be lower than this.<br /><br />You might also notice that there are two types of nuclear waste. <span style="font-weight: bold;">High-Level Nuclear Waste </span>is what I would call the typical nuclear waste. It is the spent fuel, control rods and all other materials used directly in the fission reaction. High-Level Nuclear Waste accounts for 99% of the radioactivity of all nuclear waste[1]. The other type is called Low-Level Nuclear Waste. Low-Level nuclear waste is mostly things like radioactive protection suits and other things that are indirectly exposed to the radiation of a fission reaction. These materials account for only 5% of the radiation and are thus much easier to handle and transport safely.<br /><br />Now back to the calculation. I looked at all my power bills from 2007 and totaled my kWh usage. In 2007, my house used  8208 kWh of electricity. Of that power, 7% of it was generated by Nuclear Power according to Ameren. So I take the total 1000 kWh (8.21) and multiply it by the total produced from known sources .0001 in the cases of both high and low. I get .000821 lbs of High Level Nuclear Waste and .000821 ft^3 of Low Level Nuclear Waste. One caveat on these numbers, as Ameren points out in their footnote, is that they didn''t know the waste produced by 13% of their power because they bought it from other power companies. I neglect this mainly because I''m using .0001 as my figure for Nuclear Waste, even though the actual numbers may be lower.<br /><br />Next, I decided to see what would happen if all of my power was generated by Nuclear. So I take .0001 and multiply by 100/7 to convert the waste numbers to 100% of the waste. I think this is pretty valid because the only other wastes from nuclear power operation seem to be water vapor and waste heat, which most people argue are not pollution. This gives me <.0014 lbs and <.0014 ft^3 for High and Low wastes respectively. Multiplying this out I get: .011726 lbs and .011726 ft^3 respectively again.<br /><br />Since I found it hard to wrap my head around such small numbers, I decided to look at the entire state of Illinois, my home state. For this calculation, I assume my power consumption is representative of all of the people of Illinois of which there are about 12,831,970 at the time of writing. This gives us 75.23 tons of High Level Nuclear Waste per year, and 5573 cubic yards of Low Level Nuclear Waste per year. This is if all of our power was produced by Nuclear Power.<br /><br />So 75.23 tons for Illinois sounds like a pretty big problem but let''s look at a minimum of the amount of Carbon Dioxide emissions this would remove. Ameren claims that it emits 1574 lbs of CO2 per 1000 kWh so that gives me the total output of CO2 at current power consumption levels and distribution is 82,890,625 tons per year. By going to a full nuclear power generation model, we could be reducing the carbon footprint of Illinois by 82 Million tons!! So when deciding between Nuclear Power and other options we must weigh in our head the relative advantages of both. If you think that reducing the C02, Nitrogen Oxides, and Sulfer Dioxide in the air will help improve air quality and reduce the risk of global climate change, then you have to weigh this against the negatives of having Nuclear Waste around.<br /><br />Some people think that this great reduction isn''t worth the risk of Nuclear Waste. I do not. I think that humans, when given the chance to solve a problem will be able to come up with a workable solution to dealing with Nuclear Waste.<br /><br />[1] N. Tsoulfanidis    and R.G.

I''m not sure if this idea is a great idea, but I think it''s an idea that you really have to try out to see if it will work. No amount of speculation or thought experiments will tell you the results of this. Even if education "experts" were to swear back and forth to me that this is the dumbest idea ever I''d still want to try it when I have the excess capital to do so. So here it goes:<br /><br />At age 5-7, parents, or students themselves (in the case of an orphan) apply to go to my school. I would select from the applicants who to let into the school. These school would operate like a boarding school: students would be fed meals, given housing, clothing, affection, and any other essentials necessary for survival. Neither the parents or the students would pay anything for the teaching or feeding or housing up front. Students would be taught through whatever method I and the teachers I hired found to be most efficient at the time. The reason we are motivated to teach the kids the best way possible is because of the strong incentives for creating very productive citizens. <br /><br />Using the best knowledge I have of education so far, I would want to use an un-schooling technique for teaching these children. I would strongly facilitate and cultivate whatever activities they had interest in pursuing. The main reason I believe this technique will work is because people would pursue activities that they are passionate about. In the current modern school setting, this passion cultivation is minimal. Most courses are highly specified and do not cater to individual tastes. I believe that my program would create people who are passionate about their chosen interest/field and willing to work hard to further their knowledge in that field and its supporting activities.<br /><br />In exchange for this housing, feeding, loving, and educating, I will ask that former students return a percentage of their gross revenue to school. These revenues would allow the school to continue operating for more students, and help return the investment made on that student. Profits made through this process would be the profits of the education company and its shareholders.<br /><br />The legality of this contract is one of the largest up front issues I see. Students under the age of 18  (minors) cannot make a legal contract with a school that says they will pay a portion of their gross income to the school. This common law would make it difficult to have legal recourse against students who took the benefits of the school but they chose not to return their fair share. I think that if argued it a court it might be possible to win a case around this issue, and I also believe that students will, for the most part, honor their bargain as long as the school was  nice to them and taught them properly. This would be sure to make the schools be held more accountable to their treatment of the students, because if the students find out that they were treated poorly, or not taught in an acceptable way, then they would simply stop honoring their end of the deal.<br /><br />What do you think about this system?

It talks about how hard-soled shoes make you walk in a way that forces you to put your heel on the ground before the ball of your foot (cow-stepping). If you take of your shoes and walk naturally you will realize that you stop walking this way. You start walking in a way called fox-stepping, where you put the ball of your foot down firs then slowly roll down your foot to your heel then apply the weigh of your body. This method of walking puts less stress on your joints as you walk.<br /><br />When you put your heel on the ground first you are putting all of the weight of your body on your leg bones which are completely straight. Anyone who has ever ridden a bike knows that if your seat is too high, and your legs become fully extended it is hard to pedal and bad for your joints. This is because your body is not built to be under stress at full extension. Your joints are made for bending, not for holding a rigid shape as if there was no joint at all.<br /><br />When you fox-step you avoid this stress. Instead of transferring all your weight to your foot while your knee joint is fully locked, you transfer the weight when your joints are bent. As an added bonus, when you fox-step you look more sure of yourself. Your body takes on a more natural posture, and that posture looks quite a bit more confident.<br /><br />To start, I tried walking around my block barefoot on asphalt and concrete. I quickly learned that the surfaces that humans have designed for themselves to walk on are actually terrible for human foot traffic. The rigidness of a concrete sidewalk is not a good walking surface for bare footers.  I then tried walking in the grass next to the sidewalk and found joy. I loved walking barefoot on the ground where I could feel the different textures. After trying the grass I went out into the street to see what that would feel like. The asphalt of the street had a great texture for walking barefoot on. So right off the bat I liked walking barefoot more than with shoes on 2 out of 3 surfaces. Over time I came to dislike walking barefoot on only 3 types of surfaces, and loved walking on all of the rest.<br /><br />The three surfaces I did not like walking on are concrete sidewalks, hot asphalt, and grocery store like tiled floors. Besides these surfaces, it has been a joy to walk barefoot.<br /><br />To start my barefoot trial, I decided to spend the 7 day vacation to Mauii, Hawaiii completely barefoot. I only put on shoes once, and only for about 1 minute during the entire 7 days. During the time I experiencing lava rocks, hot asphalt, beaches, restaurants, wood, 5 mile muddy hiking trail, airports, airplanes, cars, etc. It was a good experience and by the end I was starting to get callouses on my feet. Learning a <a href="http://www.barefooters.org/">barefooting</a> lifestyle under the artificial constraint of not wearing shoes for an entire vacation was a great way to introduce it to my feet and mind.<br /><br />I decided to continue to go barefoot when I came down to Champaign-Urbana for school. The number one question I got from inquisitive young minds is "What are you going to do when it gets cold?" A question to which I had no answer.<br /><br />But as it got cold, answers came. While I was siting on my porch my friend''s (<a href="http://graysonfamily.org/%7Edavid/">David Grayson</a>) dad came by and told me about some interesting barefoot running stories he had read.<a href="http://ryantm.com/why-shoes-are-bad-for-us.pdf"><br /><br /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_kIdEgOAP3dM/R6fGKIQDkEI/AAAAAAAAAAU/tIlQjOlYJXo/s1600-h/large.jpg"></a><ol><li><a href="http://ryantm.com/why-shoes-are-bad-for-us.pdf">Why shoes are bad for us (pdf)</a></li><li><a href="http://ryantm.com/men-who-run-forever.pdf">Men who run forever (pdf)</a></li></ol>These stories lead me to <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/products_classic.cfm">Vibram''s new five-toed shoes</a>. Which are quite good at protecting your feet in dry and chilly weather. Also, they fix most of the problems of traditional shoes because they<ul><li>Have a completely flat sole</li><li>Fit your feet like a glove<br /></li><li>Allow your toes to downwards as easily as upwards</li></ul>This last point is probably the most important for fox-stepping. Traditionally when people test the flexibility of shoes they only test how much the toe portion of the shoe bends up. This is not good for fox-stepping because the main mechanism of walking is to first put your toes and balls down on the ground first, which is most easily done when the toes have a lot of downward flexibility.<br /><br />So next time your are testing the flexibility of shoes make sure the toes can go down below the line of the sole.<br /><br />These shoes were great for a time, but as it started to get wetter and colder I realized that I needed something else. The reason for this is the Vibram Five-Fingers are not waterproof and they are definitely not well insulated. This combination made it hard to wear socks to keep warm, because if it got wet then the socks just made it worse anyway.<br /><br />This doesn''t mean I don''t recommend the shoes, they are great for running in and I will definitely wear them when it gets warm and dry again. But in the winter I needed something dryer and warmer.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_kIdEgOAP3dM/R6fIWYQDkGI/AAAAAAAAAAk/LeIt_8rdjbA/s1600-h/720_chocolate_moose.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_kIdEgOAP3dM/R6fIWYQDkGI/AAAAAAAAAAk/LeIt_8rdjbA/s400/720_chocolate_moose.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5163315784596033634" border="0" /></a><br />That''s where <a href="http://www.mtonka.com/ecommerce/product?product%5fid=39">Minnetonka''s Double Bottom Mooseskin</a> came along.

I''ve been wearing these shoes for the last couple of months with no problems.<br /><br />People are asking me what I''m going to do when it gets warm. The answer of course is go barefoot again!

My reasons for stopping are similar to my reasons for not drinking alcohol. I believe that you need a reason to exhibit an action and you don''t need a reason to not exhibit an action. When someone asks me, "Why don''t you drink." I say, "I need a reason to drink, not a reason to stay sober." I try to extend this thought process to many of my other habits.<br /><br />The idea is that you should examine the things that you''ve learned to do, your habits, and make sure you have reasons for doing so. I''m not suggesting you go through all of your habits at once. Doing so would be counter-productive because you can''t possible think about all of your habits at once, there are too many! Instead, just look at ones that are taking up a lot of your time, and are higher level behaviors. What I mean is that you shouldn''t examine why you use your left hand to write. You should examine why you go to work everyday, or why you wake up and read the newspaper every morning, or why when you come home from work you sit down and watch television.<br /><br />Let''s do a thought experiment now. Say you want to examine newspaper reading. If you agree with what I''ve said above, you need to look for a reason to read it.<br /><br />Newspaper Attractors (ranked most useful to least useful):<br /><ul><li>Can converse easily with other newspaper readers</li><li>Tells you the sentiment of the masses</li><li>May contain a few useful ideas or trends</li><li>Might miss out on something<br /></li></ul>Newspaper Detractors (most painful to least painful):<br /><ul><li>False positive on idea or trend<br /></li><li>Takes time to read</li><li>Encourages emotional response rather than active thinking</li></ul>It''s nice to be able to converse with people about current events because it gives you something novel and common to talk about. However with some thought, it is usually not hard to find something that is novel and common to talk about. Especially if you can make yourself genuinely interested in the activities of other people. If you are interested in their activities you instantly have a communal interest.<br /><br />The only reason to know the sentiment of the masses, or the trends is so that you can go against them. Following the trends will just put you in the same boat as other mindless people who read the newspaper. To do anything useful in life, you need to buck the trends, follow the unbeaten path. This reminds me of the phrase:<br /><blockquote>If you keep doing what you''ve always done, you''ll keep getting what you''ve always gotten.</blockquote>Only when you change yourself and not follow the trends can you accomplish something that is actually newsworthy.<br /><br />Now look at the detractors, how much time do you have to spend reading the newspaper every day just to get a little nugget of truth from the steaming pile of crap and hype? People I know spend anywhere from 15 minutes to 30 minutes a day reading the newspaper. I''m sure other people read more. If you do this everyday it really starts to add up. Think about what would happen if you instead used that time to exercise or just sit and meditate about your life. You''d be engaged in activities that have direct applicability to your life and survival, instead of reading about some esoteric far off conception of other humans.<br /><br />Even with the time issue aside, you can get false positives from the newspaper. If I had a dollar for every time the Business section of the Chicago Tribune changed from Bull to Bear on the front page, I''d be a very rich man. What the newspaper tries to convince you are sure trends are actually just the feelings and emotions of other humans. Lots of experimental evidence has shown that humans can''t predict much of anything useful about the future. This is doubly true when you are trying to predict what other humans will do. When you predict the future, the other humans are too, which creates a very chaotic environment that the so called liberal "sciences" have made little inroads on.<br /><br />I don''t trust the journalist to make predictions about events just like I don''t expect myself to be able to predict the future. Yet this is what most people get from the newspaper. They claim that they have a window into the future actions of other humans because they can read the market is going to collapse or that green is the new fashionable color for this season.<br /><br />People would be a lot better off, on a whole, if people stopped deluding themselves that they are made smarter by the words in the newspaper. Being in the know about current events, or activities does not make you more able to predict wide trends. Instead, it does the opposite: since you think that you have better knowledge of the world you predict on an even grander scale.<br /><br />This is crazy. I have a hard enough time predicting what I''ll be doing tomorrow, and I have a lot of control over my own actions and behaviors. How can I possible predict what other humans are going to do tomorrow, or next week, or next year. The person who claims he can do this is deluding themselves with the help of the newspaper and other pseudoscience information sources.<br /><br />If you see any merit in what I say, you should try a <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/">30 day trial</a> where you don''t read the newspaper. It truly is a different perspective to only look up the news that you actually care about, and to do it on your own time.<br /><br />Some people have told me that recently the financial markets have not been doing well. Some might argue that this is crucial information to know, but I don''t see how it is directly applicable to my life. What is directly applicable is how I can learn how to change myself. How I can learn how to think better and change my behaviors to reflect better thoughts. That''s what I care about and that''s what I''m trying to pursue.<br /><br />For more information about predicting the future, I recommend all of the works of <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>.', 'Why I Stopped Reading the Newspaper', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'why-i-stopped-reading-the-newspaper', '', '', '2008-02-07 22:11:00', '2008-02-08 04:11:00', '', 0, 'http://www.ryantm.com/blog/?p=27', 0, 'post', '', 0),

This misunderstanding has been capitalized by many programming types to act in a  condescending manner against the people who do not know about computers. This has led to the mistaken belief that programmers are smarter than the average person. This is not the case. Programmers are humans like everyone else who have chosen to study an area very deeply. Many other humans have chosen to study other areas deeply as well, for instance, have you ever met a sculptor, or a advertiser, or a politician? Every area where people are engaged they are studying things at a deeper level than average.

Now Google Code ranks issues on the issue page by the number of people that have starred an issue and starring an issue lets you receive updates when the issue''s status changes ( i.e. the feature is implemented). Unfortunately this also means you receive comments every time someone comments to the thread, and unfortunately as well, there are a lot of average Ruby programmers that showed up on this issue thread. The result is that since I have starred the issue, I''ve received over 300 emails from people who have written comments that say:\r\n<blockquote>+1</blockquote>\r\nYep that''s right, that''s all it says. I''ve been receiving them at what seems like two a minute, though that''s an exaggeration. People have tried to quell the mob of idiots by numerous posts telling people to stop, and that it only counts if you star it, but no one listens. They just keep posting "+1" by the hundreds. While these actions were surprising to me, they should not have been. People are going to keep following the crowd and writing plus one because they are people. Programmers aren''t different or better. Programmers are still humans.\r\n\r\nOne last thing I''d like to say that is probably the reason programmers have thought so highly of themselves and in some cases acted condescendingly to non-programmers. I believe that computer programming is an essential skill, along the lines of literacy, and speaking. The reason I categorize it with these is because, just like writing, reading and speaking, programming is game changing. With computer programming people can take an idea and propagate it massively and automatically. Properly programming something can change the way every other human who interacts with that program behaves and lives. This is powerful stuff that shouldn''t be relegated to one group of skilled persons.\r\n\r\nAnyone with programming skills can work to automate their job of doing menial tasks. For example, when I worked at Caterpillar as an engineering intern, they had about 3 people who''s primary job was to make charts and give presentations to management about these charts. The charts graphed the quality of the machines we were shipping and the manufacturing defects that were caught. I noticed that these 3 people were spending at least 3 hours a day using excel to generate these charts. So I created a Visual Basic program (the only programming language I had available to me) to generate these charts automatically in a fraction of the time. The reason I bring this up is not that I think these people should have been writing programs to do their graphs for them. I bring it up because what if they could? What if they could sit down and automate the task in front of them, and then move on to doing other useful activities for the company.\r\n\r\nThis behavior of automation of jobs at the lowest level is why I say programming changes the game like reading, writing and speaking. When people at the lowest level learned to read and write it changed the game. Literate people can communicate much more effectively with their peers and get their ideas across to a lot of people. This idea automation through literacy is paralleled by task automation through computer programming. Look at what this means, just as you can''t have an elite group of scribes that does all your information dissemination, you can''t have an elite group of programmers to do your job automation. The idea of a programmer as a skill or trade needs to be broken down before we can see the true gains in productivity that computers promise.\r\n\r\nSo I kinda jumped around a bit here, I first cut down programmers to average, then I said, "wouldn''t it be great if the average person knew how to program." I guess those ideas a bit hypocritical but they both serve to explain why I think that programmers aren''t as elite as they signal to others, and that others need to learn programming. I can hear it every time someone goes, "ooh I''m not good with computers."', 'More evidence that programmers aren''t smarter than other people', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'more-evidence-that-programmers-arent-smarter-than-other-people', '', '', '2008-04-11 12:43:18', '2008-04-11 18:43:18', '', 0, 'http://www.ryantm.com/blog/2008/04/11/more-evidence-that-programmers-arent-smarter-than-other-people/', 0, 'post', '', 12),

I''ve been using HAML since back when I made my <a href="http://www.sassins.com">Assassins Game Hosting Service</a> in 2007. If you are still using ERB or some other templating language for your web applications here is why you should given HAML a try.\r\n\r\n<strong>HAML gets rid of end tags.</strong> By using Python like indentation it removes the need for you to type all of those pesky HTML endtags. Also, it lets you quickly see the nesting of tabs simply by the indentation of the line you are on. This quick look at nesting is espcially helpful when your HTML files start to get longer than 80 lines or so.\r\n\r\n<strong>HAML generates pretty source.</strong> I am anal about how my HTML souce looks. I want it to be indented with spaces at every nesting point. If you''ve ever seen the HTML source for a webpage generated in on of the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/">terrible</a>, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/frontpage/default.aspx">horrible</a> WYSIWYG editors, you know exactly what I don''t want. Every time I look at the source of pages generated by those tools a little piece of me dies. HAML is the complete opposite of this. It generates the cleanest possible HTML document it can. The file format convinces you to write cleanly, but it also smooths over some errors you could make. For instance, if you include unnecessary newlines in your source file, HAML removes them, leaving on the effectful newlines.\r\n\r\n<strong>HAML is integrated with Ruby. </strong>ERB''s Ruby integration is a joke. All it does it execute Ruby between &lt;% %&gt; with a little extra handling for loops and if statements. HAML''s Ruby integration is like a Red Corvette. You can use = for ruby code with output, or == for ruby strings, or - for Ruby code without output. Also, now with HAML 2.0 error handling for Ruby and HAML is great a well.\r\n\r\n<strong>HAML installation is easy.</strong> You can try HAML out right away with little effort, and no conflict with your current Rails installs just do the following:\r\n<pre>gem install haml --no-ri</pre>\r\n<pre>haml --rails path/to/app</pre>\r\nI should also mention that HAML is used in my favorite <a href="http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org">static HTML generator</a>, Staticmatic.', 'HAML: why you should use it', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'haml-why-you-should-use-it', '', '', '2008-06-01 00:06:11', '2008-06-01 06:06:11', '', 0, 'http://www.ryantm.com/blog/2008/05/25/haml-why-you-should-use-it/', 0, 'post', '', 1),

My novel way is to have my open id be www.ryantm.com and then have that website <strong>delegate the authentication</strong> to another company. In my case, I picked this <a href="http://www.myopenid.com">good OpenID providor</a>. I figured out how to do this by watching <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2288395847791059857">Simon Willison''s google video talk</a>.

This works pretty well, but an version built similarly to Yahoo''s IRC chat, would shuttle most of my server load to the users computers, where they have typically resided for socket based clients in the past. This seems like it would be a great candidate for a Browser++ application but there are a couple of hangups so far.\r\n<h2>Future of Browser++</h2>\r\nI am particularly hesitant to use Browser++ tools to develop my web applications, because <strong>the web is supposed to work everywhere</strong>.

The basic principle behind this approach is to quickly write regular expressions to search for every possible word you can make a specific part of the board. By cating a scrabble word list into a pipe and using egrep with regular expressions, you can quickly and easily match patterns against your tiles and the state of the board.\r\n\r\nQuick example:\r\n<pre>$ wget http://www.ryantm.com/scrabble-word-list.tar.gz\r\n$ tar -xvzf scrabble-word-list.tar.gz\r\n$ cat scrabble-word-list | egrep "^A[EPABVT]{4}$"\r\nABATE</pre>\r\nWe''ve found a valid 5 letter scrabble word that starts with an A (^ means start of line), contains 4 of the set E,P,A,B,V,T ($ means end of word). Expanding on this concept you can do all sorts of awesome patterns.\r\n\r\nSay you want to make a word that goes from what you currently have to a triple word score 5 tiles away that connects to a D. You just do something like this:\r\n<pre>\r\n$ cat scrabble-word-list | egrep "^[EABTTE]*D$"\r\nABATED\r\nBATTED\r\nBETTED\r\nTABBED\r\nTATTED\r\nTEATED</pre>\r\nThen suddenly you''ve got a list of words that work for what you want. I did * here instead of {4} * means match as many characters as you can. It''s usually a good idea to start with * and narrow it down with {number} if you need to.  You might notice that one of them doesn''t work (TABBED), because you don''t have two B''s. The regular expression matcher doesn''t care how many times you put a letter inside a set ([]) and it will match it as many times as it can. You can filter these words quickly yourself though, because you know you don''t have two B''s.\r\n<h3>The General Principle</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Take what letters you have an form at set: [BZTQEAI]</li>\r\n	<li>Find a starting or ending place: ^ACE or Y$</li>\r\n	<li>Put it together with the number of letters you want to use: "^ACE[BZTQEAI]*"</li>\r\n	<li>Double check the word with reality</li>\r\n	<li>Repeat until you are satisfied with your word score.</li>\r\n</ol>', 'How to win at Scrabulous using Regular Expressions', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-win-at-scrabulous-using-regular-expressions', '', '', '2008-06-07 22:26:36', '2008-06-08 04:26:36', '', 0, 'http://www.ryantm.com/blog/2008/06/07/how-to-win-at-scrabulous-using-regular-expressions/', 0, 'post', '', 1),
